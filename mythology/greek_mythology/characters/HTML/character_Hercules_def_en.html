Hercules is a character in Greek mythology, the son of Zeus and Alcmene (wife of Amphitryon). He was born in Thebes, from the very birth he demonstrated extraordinary physical strength and courage, but at the same time, due to the hostility of Hera, he had to obey his relative Eurystheus. In his youth, Hercules ensured victory over Ergin for his hometown. In a fit of madness, he killed his own sons, and therefore was forced to go to the service of Eurystheus. By order of the latter, Hercules performed twelve labors.
