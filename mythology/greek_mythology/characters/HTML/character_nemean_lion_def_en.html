Nemean lion - in ancient Greek mythology, a lion of monstrous size with an incredibly hard skin, which is why not a single weapon took it. He devastated the outskirts of the cities of Nemea, Cleona and the village of Bembina. The murder of the Nemean lion was the first task that the Mycenaean king Eurystheus assigned to Hercules. When Hercules saw the lion, he hit him twice with a bow. The arrows could not pierce the animal's skin. Then the son of Zeus first stunned him with a blow on the head with a club, and then strangled him with his bare hands.
The skin of the Nemean lion has become an integral attribute of Hercules.
