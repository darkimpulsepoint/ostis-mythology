Hercules did not have to wait long for a new order from Eurystheus. This time he was to go west, where the sun chariot descends in the evening, to the Crimson Island in the middle of the ocean, where the three-headed giant Geryon grazes his herd of purple cows. The king ordered to drive these cows to Mycenae.

And Hercules went to the sunset. He passed many countries and finally came to high mountains at the end of the earth, and began to look for an outlet to the ocean. The high granite mountains stood in a continuous impenetrable ridge. Then Hercules loosened two huge steep slopes and pushed them apart. Water gushed between them, and it was the water of the Ocean. The sea that lay in the middle of the earth and which people call the Mediterranean joined the Ocean. They still stand there on the shore of the strait, like two stone guards, huge, majestic Pillars of Hercules.

Hercules passed through the mountains and saw the endless ocean surface. Somewhere out there, in the middle of the ocean, lay the Crimson Island - the island of the three-headed Geryon. But where is the place where the sun goes beyond the boundless waters of the gray ocean?

Hercules waited for the evening, sees: an ancient titan - Helios-Sun - descends on his fiery chariot drawn by four horses. He scorched the body of Hercules with unbearable heat. "Hey! - shouted Hercules to the titan, - don't you want to incinerate me with your rays! Beware, I am the son of Zeus! From my arrows and the gods lose their immortality!" Heracles drew a bow, put an arrow on it and aimed at the solar titan. Instantly freshened up around, Hercules lowered the onion - again the heat began to grow.

The unbearable light made Hercules close his eyes, and when he opened them, he saw Helios standing nearby. "I see now that you really are the son of Zeus, - said Helios, - courage in you beyond human measure. I will help you. Sit in my golden boat, and do not be afraid of my heat, you will not burn with fire, unless your skin turns black a little."

A huge golden boat, similar to a bowl, received the solar titan with his chariot and Hercules.

Soon an island appeared among the waves - indeed Crimson. Everything on it was painted purple-red: rocks, sand, trunks and foliage of trees ...

"Here it is, the island of Erifia, - said Helios. - This is the goal of your path. Farewell, Hercules, I must hurry. During the night I have to go around the whole earth, so that in the morning, as always, ascend to heaven in the east."

Hercules went ashore, and a dark night enveloped him, - Helios sailed away in a golden boat on his eternal road further. And Hercules lay down on the ground, covered himself with a lion's skin and fell asleep.

He slept soundly and woke up only in the morning from a hoarse barking. Above him stood a huge shaggy dog ​​with hair the color of fresh blood and barked ferociously. "Take him, Orff, rip his throat!" - Hercules heard, and the dog immediately rushed at him.

Hercules' club was always at his fingertips - one swing, and the monstrous dog, spawned by Typhon and the Echidna, rolled on the ground with his head pierced. But then a new adversary appeared - a huge shepherd. His hair, beard, face, clothes, like everything else on this island, were fiery red. He brandished his shepherd's stick and, spewing curses, attacked Hercules. This fight was not long. The son of Zeus hit the shepherd in the chest, so much so that he laid him dead next to the killed dog.

Now Hercules could and look around. He saw a herd at the edge of the forest: the cows in it were red, and the bulls were black. They were guarded by another shepherd, but with a black face, black beard and black clothes. Hercules did not have to fight with him: at the sight of the hero, he rushed off into the forest with a cry.

Only one enemy remained with Hercules - the three-headed giant Geryon. From behind the forest, a terrible triple roar was heard, the owner of the herd himself was in a hurry to the pasture.

Hercules has never seen such a monster! Three bodies were fused in it: three pairs of arms, three pairs of legs, three heads and only one belly was common - a huge one, like a wine vat at folk games. Quickly moving his legs, like a giant insect, he rushed to Hercules.

Hercules raised his bow - an arrow soaked in the poison of the Lernaean hydra whistled, pierced Geryon's middle chest, and his middle head bent, and two hands hung helplessly. The first arrow was followed by a second, followed by a third. But Geryon was still alive - the blood of his huge body slowly absorbed the poison. Like three lightning bolts, Hercules struck three crushing blows on Geryon's heads, and only then did he come to an end.

The feat was accomplished. All that remained was to bring the herd to Mycenae. Near the killed shepherd, Hercules found a pipe, put it to his lips, played, and the herd obediently followed him to the ocean shore.

In the evening, when Helios sailed to the shore on a golden boat, Hercules asked him to transport him with the herd to the mainland. "How can I do this? - Helios was surprised. - What will people say when they see the sun coming back? Let's do this: drive the herd onto a boat, get in it yourself and sail to the mainland. I will wait here, and the boat will be returned to me. your intercessor Pallas Athena. "

And so Hercules did. He sailed the Ocean to the east, to the coast of the mainland and drove the herd of Geryon through the mountains, through foreign countries - to Mycenae. An arduous path lay before him.

When Hercules drove the herd through Italy, one of the cows fell into the sea, but did not drown, and, having crossed the stormy strait, got out to the opposite shore, the shore of Trinacria island smoking with smoke. The king of the island, Eric, was incredibly delighted to see a cow of such an unusual red color and decided to keep it for himself. Hercules, however, left the herd in the care of Hephaestus, whom Athena sent to help her pet and, having moved to the island, began to demand the cow back. King Eric did not want to return the priceless cow. He offered Hercules a duel, and a cow was to be the winner's reward. This single combat did not last long. Hercules Eric defeated, returned with the cow to the herd and drove him further.

Many more difficulties awaited Hercules on the way back: the robber Kakus, who lived on the Avetino hill, stole part of the herd and hid it in his cave, but Hercules killed him and returned the stolen cows; here, in Italy, he killed another robber named Croton and said over his body that the time would come when a great city named after him would arise on this place.

Finally Hercules reached the shores of the Ionian Sea. The end of the arduous journey was near, the native land of Hellas was very close. However, where the Adriatic Gulf protrudes most into the land, Hera sent a gadfly to the herd. As if the whole herd was enraged by his bites, the bulls and cows rushed to run, Hercules followed them. The chase continued for days and nights. Epirus and Thrace were left behind, and a herd was lost in the endless Scythian steppe.

For a long time Hercules searched for the missing animals, but he could not find even a trace of them. One cold night, he wrapped himself in a lion's skin and fell fast asleep on the side of a rocky hill. Through a dream he heard an insinuating voice: "Hercules ... Hercules ... I have your flock ... Do you want me to return it to you ..."

Hercules woke up and saw in the ghostly moonlight a half-virgin-half-snake: her head and body were female, and instead of legs - a snake body.

"I know you," Hercules said to her. "You are Echidna, daughter of Tartarus and Gaia. I see, and you know me. You bet! It was I who destroyed your children, and the Nemean lion, and the Lernean hydra, and the two-headed dog Orff."

“I do not hold a grudge against you, Hercules, - answered Echidna, - not by your will, but by the will of fate, my children died. But be fair, hero, because your hand, even if directed by fate, took their lives. in return for the three you killed, three alive. Become my spouse only for one night! Let me give birth to three sons from you! For this I will return your flock to you. " Hercules nodded his head in agreement: "Only for one night ..."

In the morning, Echidna returned the herd to Hercules safe and sound - not a single cow, not a single bull was missing.

"What should I do with three sons, whom I already carry in my womb," Echidna asked. "When they grow big, - answered Hercules, - give them my bow and belt. If any of them bend my bow and girdle like I do, then appoint him as ruler of this vast country."

Having said this, Hercules gave Echidna his bow and belt. Then he played the shepherd's pipe and went his own way. Behind him obediently walked and Geryon's herd.

Echidna named the triplets born on time as Agathirs, Gelon and Scyth. Only the Scythian managed to pull the bow of his father, and only he could fit the belt of Hercules. He became the lord of the free, green Black Sea steppes, giving this land his name - Great Scythia.

Hercules returned to Mycenae. He fulfilled the tenth order of Eurystheus with dignity. But, as before, Eurystheus did not even want to look at the cows and bulls of Geryon. By his order, the entire flock was sacrificed to the goddess Hera.
