The death of Chiron and his voluntary departure from life shocked Hercules. He never left the house, conducting an endless conversation with Iolaus about two worlds: the world of the living and the world of the dead.

"What is the meaning of life? What is its Truth?" Asked Hercules Iolaus, and answered himself. "Living life fights the dead, and this is the whole truth - in their struggle. Truth is only in living life, where there is joy, and sadness. In the world of dead life there is no Truth - there is only oblivion. I am mortal, but there is thought in me. Is it not she who fights death? But strength is needed to fight. Is not thought power? Does not thought conquer both great and The higher the thought, the stronger. Thought feeds on knowledge, and knowledge always serves people - otherwise it dies. But what do I know? My knowledge is no more than a spark in the radiance of a star rain. When this spark goes out, the truth for me will disappear, and darkness will come. "

"Or maybe darkness is also the truth?" Iolaus asked.

So friends talked day and night.

One evening, their conversation was interrupted by Koprey, who appeared with a new order from Eurystheus.

"The king, - said Koprey, - instead of another feat, he invites you, Hercules, to hunt wild ducks or something like that. There was a rumor that birds called Stimfalids were bred on Lake Stimphalids. You must shoot them - that's all." ...

When the herald of Eurystheus left, Hercules said to Iolaus: "I also heard about these birds. These are the birds of Ares, the god of war. They have copper beaks and claws. But not in their beaks and claws, their main strength, but in the copper feathers that they throw, like arrows, and killing people with them, they feed on human flesh. And yet I think that the real danger for us is not in the copper-fin Stimfalids, but in what - we'll see. "

"You said it well," Iolaus replied, "I see that you want to take me with you!"

Although Stimfalskoye Lake lay in Arcadia, it was not far from the borders of Argolis. After two days of travel, Hercules and Iolaus came to a gloomy hollow, at the bottom of which Lake Stimfalskoe glittered.

Everything around was deserted and wild: bare stones, no grass, no flower, no tree. The wind did not stir the ripples of the smooth surface of the lake, the lizard did not bask in the sun. There was dead silence.

Hercules and Iolaus sat on the stones by the water and silently looked at the motionless lake. Longing attacked them, fatigue bound their body, it became difficult to breathe.

"Something is wrong with me," Hercules said. "It's hard for me to breathe, and the bow falls out of my hands ... This lake breathes the poisoned haze of the underworld. I feel the musty air of the kingdom of the dead ... Oh, Zeus! Let me die not here, but on some mountain peak! "

"The dream of death is taking possession of me too," Iolaus whispered under his breath.

Suddenly, a simple wooden rattle fell from the sky at Iolaus's feet, which peasants chase birds out of gardens and vegetable gardens. She was sent by Athena, a wise mentor and helper of people. Iolaus grabbed her and began to shake her. She crackled loudly over the sleeping lake, and the echo multiplied the noise she made a hundredfold. And then a huge bird rose from the poplar grove, followed by another, a third, many ... In a long line, blocking the sun, they glided over the smooth surface of Lake Stymphalian. Another moment and a hail of sharp copper feathers fell on the shore, where Hercules was sitting with his friend.

It is good that Hercules did not part with his cloak made of the skin of the Nemean lion - he managed to cover himself with it and cover Iolaus. The deadly feathers of Stemphalides were now fearless. Hercules grabbed his bow and from under his cloak began to hit the monstrous birds one after another.

Many Stymphalides, slain by the arrows of Hercules, fell into the black waters of the lake. Now it was no longer calm, the water bubbled in it, white steam rose to the sky. The surviving birds soared under the clouds and disappeared from sight. In fear, they flew far beyond the borders of Hellas - to the shores of the Euxine Pontus and never returned.

"We'll leave sooner from here, until we are once again clouded with poisonous haze," said Hercules and, throwing Athena's rattle into the boiling water, walked away.

The further the friends went from the sworn place, the more cheerful they felt. But for a long time a strange languor and aching bones reminded them of the deadly breath of Lake Stimfalskoye.
