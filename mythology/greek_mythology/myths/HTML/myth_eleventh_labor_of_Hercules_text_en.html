Long ago, when the gods celebrated the wedding of Zeus and Hera on the bright Olympus, Gaia-Earth gave the bride a magic tree on which golden apples grew. These apples had the ability to bring back youth. But none of the people knew where the garden was, where the wonderful apple tree was growing. It was rumored that this garden belongs to the Hesperid nymphs and is located at the very edge of the earth, where the titan Atlas holds the firmament on his shoulders, and the gigantic hundred-headed serpent Ladon, born of the sea deity Forcy and the titanide Keto, guards the apple tree with the golden fruits of youth.

While Hercules wandered the earth, fulfilling the orders of the king, Eurystheus became older and weaker every day. He was already beginning to fear that Hercules would take away his power and become king himself. So Eurystheus decided to send Hercules for golden apples in the hope that he would not return from such and such a distance - he would either perish on the way, or perish in a fight with Ladon.

As always, Eurystheus conveyed his order through the herald Koprey. Heracles Koprey listened, silently threw a lion's skin over his shoulders, took a bow with arrows and a faithful companion, a club, and once again set off on the road.

Again Hercules went through all Hellas, all of Thrace, visited the country of Hyperboreans and finally came to the distant river Eridanus. The nymphs who lived on the banks of this river were filled with pity for the wandering hero and advised him to turn to the prophetic sea elder Nereus, who knew everything in the world. "If not the wise old man Nereus, then no one can show you the way," said the nymphs to Hercules.

Hercules went to the sea, began to call Nereus. The waves poured onto the shore, and the merry Nereids, the daughters of the sea elder, emerged from the depths of the sea on frisky dolphins, and behind them appeared Nereus himself with a long gray beard. "What do you want from me, mortal?" - asked Nereus. "Show me the way to the garden of the Hesperides, where, according to rumors, an apple tree grows with the golden fruits of youth," Hercules asked.

So Nereus answered the hero: "I know everything, I see everything that is hidden from the eyes of people - but I don't tell everyone about that. And I won't tell you anything. Go, mortal, on your way." Hercules got angry, and with the words "you will say, old man, when I lightly squeeze you," he grabbed Nereus with his mighty arms.

In an instant, the sea elder turned into a big fish and slipped out of the embrace of Hercules. Hercules stepped on the tail of the fish - she hissed and turned into a snake. Hercules grabbed the snake - it turned into fire. Heracles scooped up water from the sea, wanted to pour the fire - the fire turned into water, and the water ran to the sea, to its native element.

Yes, it is not so easy to leave the son of Zeus! Hercules dug a hole in the sand and he blocked the water's path to the sea. And the water suddenly rose like a pillar and became a tree. Heracles swung his sword, wanted to cut down a tree - the tree turned into a white bird-seagull.

What was there left to do for Hercules? He raised his bow and drew the string. It was then, frightened by the deadly arrow, Nereus obeyed. He assumed his original appearance and said: "You are strong, mortal, and brave beyond human measure. All the secrets of the world can be revealed to such a hero. Listen to me and remember. The path to the garden in which an apple tree with golden fruits grows lies across the sea in the sultry Libya. Then follow the sea coast to the west until you reach the end of the earth. There you will see the titan Atlanta, who has been holding the firmament on his shoulders for a thousand years - so he is punished for the rebellion against Zeus. The garden of the nymphs-Hesperides is nearby. In that garden what you are looking for. But how to pick the cherished apples for you - decide for yourself. The hundred-headed snake Ladon will not let you get close to Hera's apple tree. "

"Accept my gratitude, prophetic old man," Hercules said to Nerei, "but I want to ask you for one more service: take me to the other side of the sea. The circular path to Libya is too long, and across the sea is just a stone's throw away."

Nereus scraped his gray beard and, with a sigh, offered Hercules his back.

On the same day, at noon, Hercules found himself in sultry Libya. For a long time he wandered along the loose sands under the burning rays of the sun and met a giant as tall as a ship's mast.

"Stop!" Shouted the giant. "What do you want in my wilderness?"

"I go to the ends of the world, looking for the garden of the Hesperides, where the tree of youth grows," Hercules replied.

The giant blocked the way to Hercules. "I am the master here," he said menacingly. "I am Antaeus, the son of Gaia-Earth. I do not let anyone pass through my possessions. Fight with me. Defeat me - you will go further, if not, you will stay." And the giant pointed to a pile of skulls and bones, half buried in sand.

Hercules had to fight with the son of the Earth. Hercules and Antaeus attacked each other at once, clasped their hands. Antaeus was huge, heavy and strong as a stone, but Hercules turned out to be more agile: having contrived, he threw Antaeus to the ground and pressed him to the sand. But as if Antaeus's forces had multiplied tenfold, he threw Hercules off himself like a feather, and hand-to-hand combat began again. The second time, Hercules knocked over Antaeus, and again the son of the Earth easily rose, as if he had gained strength from the fall ... Hercules was surprised at the giant's strength, but before he met him for the third time in a deadly duel, he realized: Antaeus is the son of the Earth, she Gaia gives her son new strength every time he touches her.

The outcome of the duel was now a foregone conclusion. Hercules, tightly grasping Antaeus, lifted him up above the ground and held him like that until he suffocated in his arms.

Now the path to the garden of the Hesperides was clear. Hercules reached the edge of the world without interference, where the sky touches the earth. Here he saw the titan Atlanta propping up the firmament with his shoulders.

"Who are you and why did you come here?" - Atlas asked Hercules.

"I need apples from the tree of youth that grows in the garden of the Hesperides," Hercules replied.

Atlas laughed: "You cannot get these apples. They are guarded by a hundred-headed dragon. He does not sleep day or night and does not let anyone near the tree. But I can help you: after all, the Hesperides are my daughters. You just stand in my place and hold heaven, and I'll go and get some apples. Will three be enough for you? "

Hercules agreed, put his weapon and lion's skin on the ground, stood next to the titan and put his shoulders under the firmament. Atlas straightened his tired back and went for the golden apples.

The crystal dome of the sky fell on the shoulders of Hercules with a terrible weight, but he stood like an indestructible rock and waited ...

Finally Atlas returned. Three golden apples sparkled in his hands. “Who should I give them to?” He asked. “Tell me, I'll go and give it. I really want to walk on the ground.

"Wait," Hercules said calmly, "let me just put the lion's skin on my shoulders. Put the apples on the ground and hold the sky until I get comfortable."

Apparently not far off was the mind of the titan Atlas. He put the apples on the ground and again heaved the sky on his shoulders. And Hercules picked up the golden apples, wrapped himself in a lion's skin, bowed to Atlanta and left without even looking back.

Hercules continued to walk even when night fell to the ground. He hurried to Mycenae, anticipating that the end of his service to King Eurystheus was coming. Stars were falling from the night sky. It was Atlas who was shaking the firmament in anger at Hercules.

"Here, Eurystheus, I brought you the apples of the Hesperides. Now you can become young again," said Hercules, returning to Mycenae.

Eurystheus extended his hands to the golden apples, but immediately pulled it back. He was scared. "These are Hera's apples," he thought, "what if she will punish me if I eat them."

Eurystheus stamped his feet. "Get lost with these apples!" He shouted at Hercules. "Get out of my palace! You can throw these apples away!"

Hercules left. He walked home and wondered what to do with the apples of youth. Suddenly, the goddess of wisdom Athena appeared before him. "Wisdom is more precious than youth" - as if someone whispered to him. Hercules handed the apples to Athena, she took them with a smile and disappeared.
