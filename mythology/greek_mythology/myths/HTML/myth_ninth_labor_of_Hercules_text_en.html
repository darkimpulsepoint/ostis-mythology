King Eurystheus had a young daughter, Admet. One day she came to her father and said: "They say that far in the east there is a kingdom where women rule. Armed with arrows, they gallop on war horses and fight bravely against enemies. They call themselves Amazons, despise men and are proud of their invincibility. My patroness Hera revealed to me that all the power of the Amazons is hidden in a simple leather belt, which the god of war Ares gave to his daughter, the queen of the Amazons, Hippolyta. While she wears this belt, no one can defeat her, and with her all the Amazons. Father! I want to be invincible like this woman, and reign without sharing power with anyone. I want to get the belt of Hippolyta! "

So there was another thing for Hercules worthy of his strength and courage. Eurystheus ordered Hercules to go for the belt of the queen of the Amazons.

Far is the way to the land of the Amazons. To reach the kingdom of Hippolyta, it was necessary to cross the Middle Sea to its eastern shores, and there, passing through two narrow straits, sail further east along the waters of another sea - Pontus of Euxine. Where the hot river Fermodont flows into the Euxine Sea is Themiscira, the main city of the country of the Amazons.

Hercules equipped the ship, called with him his faithful friends - Iolaus, the Athenian prince Theseus and others. On the appointed day, Hercules' ship set sail and went to sea.

The first anchorage of the ship was on the island of Paros, where the sons of the Cretan king Minos ruled. On this island, the sons of Minos killed two companions of Hercules. Hercules got angry with the princes. He killed many inhabitants of Paros, while others drove into the city and kept them under siege until the besieged ambassadors were sent to Hercules with a request that he take any two inhabitants of the city instead of the killed companions. Then Hercules lifted the siege and took the grandsons of Minos Alkeus and Sfenela instead of those killed.

From Paros, Hercules arrived in Mysia to the king Likus, who received him with great hospitality. In gratitude, Hercules helped Lik to defeat the tribe of lawless bebriks, with whom Lik had long been at enmity.

Further, the path of the ship ran to Troy. The Trojan kingdom was ruled at that time by Laomedont, one of the most arrogant kings, who despised even the gods. Once he decided to strengthen the already impregnable Trojan walls. To test the Trojan king, Apollo and Poseidon offered him their help for a very small fee. For a whole year, like simple bricklayers, the gods worked, strengthening the fortress walls of Troy, but they did not receive the promised reward. The arrogant king even threatened to cut off their ears if they demanded payment for their work. Then the angry Apollo sent a plague to the possessions of Laomedont, and Poseidon - a monster that devastated, sparing no one, the vicinity of Troy. The king called the soothsayers, and they announced to him: "Give your beloved daughter Hesion to be devoured by a monster, and the gods will tame their wrath." It fell to Laomedont, at the request of the people,leave young Hesione on the shore, tied tightly to the sea cliff.

Here Hercules saw Hesion when his ship approached the Trojan coast. He took off the fetters from the young maiden, doomed to a terrible death, and took her to her father. "I return to you, king, your beloved daughter. On the way to your palace, I learned that she is a ransom sacrifice for your arrogance. And do you regret giving your beloved child to be devoured by the sea monster? I would like to fight this monster, and, if my strength is enough, defeat him. And I ask for a small fee: only four good horses. "

Laomedont gladly accepted the offer of Hercules, and promised not ordinary horses as a reward, but immortals, whom he received from Zeus as a ransom for the son of Ganymede, carried away by the Thunderer to Olympus.

Hercules went to the seashore. He began to wait for the monster to come out of the sea. I waited all day. Only in the evening did the monster crawl out onto land. It opened its gigantic mouth and rushed at Hercules. And Hercules only needed this: he himself jumped into the monster's throat and began to strike with a sharp sword from within his insatiable womb.

The monster died. Hercules got out of his womb, washed off the disgusting thick mucus from himself with sea water and went for the promised reward.

"A dead monster lies on the shore," Hercules said to Laomedont. "Go and look at him if you want. Where are your four immortal horses?"

The Trojan king laughed: "Why do you need horses, Hercules? You have a ship. So sail on it further. These horses were given to me by Zeus himself, is it good to give a gift?"

"Okay, - restraining his anger, Hercules replied, - I really have a ship, and soon I will return on it to continue the conversation with you about what can be called good and what is bad."

And again the ship of Hercules went to sea. His path lay through the narrow strait separating Europe from Asia, through the Hellespont to the stormy Pontus of Euxine.

This part of the journey was well known to Hercules: he passed here with Jason in the high-speed "Argo". But then the death of his favorite, young Hilas, forced Hercules to return halfway back to Mycenae.

Hercules looked sadly at the shore, where his young friend disappeared. And the ship, cutting through the green waves, quickly raced farther and farther to the east.

Finally, the fresh wind of the Euxine Pontus, tirelessly filling the sail, brought the ship of Hercules to the mouth of the river, swirling with steam. This was Fermodont. From here it was already a stone's throw to the capital of the Amazons, Themiscira.

The gates of Themiscira were locked when Hercules with a small detachment approached the city. The gate was guarded by an Amazon guard in a leather helmet, a short tunic, with a small, moon-like shield in her hands and an ax with two semicircular blades.

"Why did you, strangers come to our land? What do you need in the kingdom of women warriors?" The guard asked.

"I did not come here with my friends of my own free will," Hercules answered her. "King Mycenae Eurystheus sent me. His daughter Admeta wants to own your queen's belt. If your queen gives me this belt, I will serve her any service."

"The queen will be reported about this, - said the guard, - wait."

Soon a detachment of horsemen marched out of the city gates. It was Queen Hippolyta with her inner circle. “Who needs my belt? Isn't it you, bearded giant?” Hippolyta asked, turning to Hercules. get it, but only in battle. "

Without another word, Hippolyta turned her horse around and headed into the city, followed by her armed detachment. Only the closest friend of Hippolyta, the beautiful Antiope, hesitated a little: she could not take her eyes off the stately companion of Hercules, the Athenian prince Theseus.

Like an indomitable forest fire, love for Theseus flared up in Antiope's heart. She knew that the Amazons were invincible as long as Hippolyta was in possession of the coveted belt, she knew that a battle with aliens was inevitable and that Theseus would inevitably die in this battle.

Late at night, Antiope made her way to the camp of Hercules, quietly entered Theseus' tent and put at his feet the belt of Hippolyta that she had stolen.

And early in the morning, a battle broke out under the walls of Themiscira. Like a whirlwind, the Amazons flew into the camp of Hercules. Aela, the most impetuous of the Amazons, was ahead of all. It was with her that Hercules fought. Reflecting her onslaught, he put her to flight and struck with a sword. Another Amazon, Protoe, slain the seven companions of Hercules, but she herself fell at the hands of the son of Zeus. Then three Amazons attacked Hercules at once, three magnificent hunters, whom Artemis herself took with her to hunt - they had no equal in javelin throwing. Three spears flew at once at Hercules, but they all missed the mark.

Fear seized the Amazons. "Woe to us! Where is your belt, Hippolyta!" They shouted.

A pang of conscience squeezed the heart of Antiope, who betrayed her friends, but love for Theseus defeated all other feelings in her.

With despair in her soul, Queen Hippolyta rushed into the thick of the battle. She knew that her cherished belt was in the hands of the enemy. Hercules struck her with his arrow.

Seeing the death of their queen, the Amazons fled. Many of them were taken prisoner, many were killed.

Hercules gave the captive Antiope to Theseus. Here the reason for such an easy victory over the Amazons was revealed. "Take, friend, the belt of Hippolyta," Theseus said to Hercules, "and say thank you to my captive Antiope." Hercules did not answer, for there was something dishonest in the victory over the Amazons. "

In Mycenae, Hercules gave the belt of Hippolyta to Eurystheus, and he gave it to his daughter Admeta, but she was afraid to own it. "May this divine belt return to the gods," Admeta decided and gave it to the temple of Hera as a gift to the goddess.

Hercules did not forget the insult inflicted on him by Laomedont. Now, having executed the next order of Eurystheus, Hercules decided that it was time to take revenge on the Trojan king for his treachery. With a small retinue, he landed on the Trojan coast. After a short siege, proud Troy fell. Laomedont and his sons were put to death, except for the youngest named Podark. "I give life to the last of the Trojan kings," said Hercules, "but first he must be sold as a slave." When the Gift was put up for sale, his sister Hesiona, saved by Hercules from the sea monster, bought her brother, giving him a gilded veil that adorned her head. So Podark received the name Priam, which means "bought". By the will of fate, he really turned out to be the last Trojan king.
