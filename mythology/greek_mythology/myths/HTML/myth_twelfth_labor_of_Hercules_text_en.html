A few days later, a herald entered the house of Hercules and said: "King Eurystheus sends you a new, this time the last order. You will carry it out - and you are free. You must go down to the kingdom of Hades and bring the three-headed dog Cerberus, the guardian of the underworld, to Mycenae."

This order was worth eleven previous ones. Descend into the realm of the dead, tame the monstrous dog and return to earth alive? Even the son of Zeus can hardly do that! Hercules bypassed the entire earth from east to west, fought with monsters and fierce robbers, paved the way to the extreme reaches of the earth and swam across the ocean with the Sun. Now he had to go where no mortal had ever come back â€” to the land of the dead.

"I will drag Cerberus on a rope, like a homeless dog, directly to the palace, but after that I am no longer a servant of Eurystheus," Hercules said to the king's herald and, banging his mighty fist on the table, set off on the road.

Hercules walked, looked at the blooming land, at the blue sea, at the whole warm, sunny world, and longing squeezed his heart. It is frightening for the living to leave at will to the kingdom of the dead!

Hercules reached the very south of the Peloponnese, here in the Tenar cave, was the entrance to the abode of Hades. He found Tenara's cave and began to descend into the depths of the earth along the bed of an underground river. Suddenly, behind his back, he heard light steps. Hercules looked back and in the whitish gloom he saw Hermes, the winged messenger of Zeus.

"The Lord of Olympus has commissioned me to be your guide, Hercules," said Hermes. He took the hero's hand, and together they began to descend deeper and deeper into the womb of Gaia.

Soon, in the swirling vapors of the earthly breath, they saw a white rock.

"This is Leukada," Hermes explained, "the river of Oblivion, the quiet Lethe flows under it. On the rock, the shadows of the dead leave memories of their earthly life, and Lethe covers them with water. Only after drinking sacrificial blood, the shadows of the dead for a short time can remember who they and what happened to them when they lived in the world of the living.

The River of Oblivion flowed into another, muddy, muddy river Acheron. A fragile wooden canoe stood on its shore, and a sullen, bearded carrier waited for the newcomers.

"Hello, Charon!" Said Hermes. "I hope you will take us to the other side free of charge out of old friendship?"

Charon silently pointed to a spot in the boat. Hermes, followed by Hercules, entered the boat, and the water rumbled softly under her keel.

On the other side was a grove of black poplars. The shadows of the dead darted uneasily among the trees. Their movements were disorderly, they collided with each other like a crowd of suddenly blind people.

"These are the shadows of people, over whose bodies the funeral rite has not been performed," Hermes whispered.

Behind the poplar grove was a wall with brass gates. They were wide open, and in front of them sat a gigantic three-headed dog - the guardian of the underworld.

The dog wagged its tail quite amiably and, like an ordinary yard dog, shook its six ears. Only the tangle of small black snakes that grew on his back instead of wool hissed and stuck out their forked tongues, and the dragon's head at the end of its tail bared its sharp teeth.

"He did not sense in you, Hercules, his mortal enemy, - said Hermes, - however, he shows complacency to everyone who comes in. But to those who try to leave, he is merciless."

Outside the gate was an immense meadow overgrown with pale yellow flowers. A host of shadows hovered over the meadow. Their pale, ghostly faces expressed neither joy nor suffering. Hercules recognized many, but no one recognized him.

Behind the meadow appeared the palace of the ruler of the kingdom of the dead, Hades and his wife Persephone. But Hermes led Hercules to a turbulent stream noisy nearby.

"This is a river called Styx," said Hermes, "the oath by the waters of this river is terrible even for the gods. It plunges into the depths of the earth, into Tartarus, the most terrible place even here, in the kingdom of Hades." No mortal has seen what I am going to show you now. "

Hermes caught Hercules, and in smooth circles they sank to the very bottom of the abyss. Here, complete darkness reigned, the space around was only occasionally illuminated by a crimson, like a reflection of a distant fire, light.

"We are in the depths of the kingdom of Hades," Hermes continued, "to the abyss of torment. Here those who have stained themselves with crimes and unrighteous life suffer. Look: Sisyphus is rolling a heavy stone uphill from Corinth. His work is meaningless - at the very top the stone will break off. and roll down, and Sisyphus, exhausted, drenched in sweat, again rolls him to the top. And so - forever. And there is Tantalus, who was once the favorite of the gods and the happiest of mortals. He stands up to his throat in water. His lips are blackened with thirst, but he will never be able to get drunk: as soon as he bends down to the water, the water will disappear. Look, Hercules, tell people about what you saw when you return to earth. Let them know that there is no crime without retribution for it. "

After these words, Hermes again grabbed the camp of Hercules with his hand, and they found themselves in front of the copper doors, which had turned green from time to time, of the palace of the ruler of the kingdom of the dead, Hades.

"Now I must leave you, - said Hermes. You must accomplish your last feat in the service of King Eurystheus without my help." In his winged sandals, Hermes soared into the air and quickly disappeared from sight.

And Hercules raised a club, with which he never parted, and hit it on the brass doors. They shuddered, but withstood the blow. Gathering all his strength, Hercules struck a second time - the rumble was heard throughout the underworld, but the copper doors still stood unshakably. For the third time, Hercules lowered a heavy club along the alignments - the clang of broken locks was heard, and the doors swung open.

Hercules entered the palace chambers and saw Hades himself, the lord of the kingdom of the dead, and his wife Persephone. They sat on two gilded thrones and looked in amazement at the living person. Hercules, majestic and calm, fearlessly stood before them, leaning on his huge club.

"A man in a lion's skin, with a club and a bow over his shoulders? Yes, it's not otherwise Hercules, the son of Zeus, has come to us," Hades said. "What do you want?" Ask. I will not deny you anything. You are my nephew after all, after all. "

"Oh, the ruler of the kingdom of the dead, - answered Hercules, - do not be angry with me for my invasion! And I have only one request: give me the dog Cerberus. I must take him to King Eurystheus. This is his last order. I will carry it out - and I will be free. ".

"I allow you to take Kerber to the ground," Hades said, "if he lets you out of here and if you take him without weapons, with your bare hands."

Heracles thanked Aida and went back to the gate, which was guarded by Kerber. They were now closed. Kerber slept in front of them, laying all three of his heads on the black road.

Hearing Hercules' footsteps, Kerber woke up, jumped up, growled and rushed swiftly at Hercules. Hercules put forward his left hand, wrapped in a lion's skin, and with his right grabbed the dog by the neck. Cerberus howled, his wild howl spread throughout the underworld. With the teeth of all three heads, he dug into the lion's skin, the snakes on the dog's back began to spit poison, and the dragon's head, growing at the tip of his tail, snapped sharp teeth at Hercules' bare feet.

And Hercules did not feel pain. He tightly squeezed the dog's neck and dragged him along with him to the river bank, to the ferry. There, on the shore, the half-choked Kerber fell to the ground, his three tongues fell out of his mouths, the snake's heads drooped, and the evil eyes of the dragon's head closed. Hercules threw a chain around the dog's neck, pulled it twice, and the terrible dog got up and dutifully dragged himself along after the winner.

The carrier Charon was horrified when he saw Hercules leading Cerberus on the chain. "Take me to the other side, old man," Hercules said to Charon. "And don't think that I stole this dog: Hades allowed me to take the dog to the ground."

The old carrier did not dare to contradict Hercules. Dangerously avoiding Cerberus, he put Hercules in the boat and nimbly worked the oars.

Having crossed the Acheron River, Hercules went the already familiar road to the Oblivion River. Kerber, head down to the ground, minced dejectedly beside him.

So they reached the meadow overgrown with yellow flowers. The exit to the ground, to warmth and light, was very close. Suddenly Hercules heard a plaintive groan: "Stop, friend Hercules, help!"

Hercules sees: two people have grown to the granite rock. He recognized one at once. It was Theseus, the Athenian prince, with whom they once sailed to Colchis, for the golden fleece, and mined Hippolyta's belt. The other, completely exhausted, Hercules recognized with difficulty. It was Peyrite, king of Thessaly. He was never a friend of Hercules, but still they knew each other.

"Oh, great son of Zeus," Theseus continued to moan. "Free us. Pride brought us to great torment. We dared to take away his wife from Hades himself and now we pay for it. We have been standing here for more than one year, adhered to this rock. So Hades punished us for our insolence. Free us! There is no more strength to stand here, neither alive nor dead. "

Hercules extended his hand to Theseus - the rock cracked and Theseus freed. Hercules held out his hand to Peyrito - the earth shook, and Hercules realized that the gods did not want his release. Heracles obeyed the will of the gods and went with the liberated Theseus to the earth, to the warmth and the sun.

When the exit to the ground was very close, Kerber began to squeal pitifully and almost crawled after Hercules. And when they went out into the open space, the sun's rays blinded the underground guard, he trembled, yellow foam dripped from his mouths, and wherever it fell to the ground, poisonous grass grew.

Theseus, gray-haired, bent over like a hundred-year-old man, went to his native Athens, and Hercules - in the other direction, to Mycenae, which he hated.

In Mycenae, Hercules, as promised, brought Cerberus directly to the royal palace. Eurystheus came to indescribable horror at one glance at the terrible dog.

Hercules laughed, looking at the cowardly king. "Well, run, come back and wait for Eurystheus at the copper gates of Hades," said Hercules and took off the chain from Kerber. And the dog in an instant rushed back to the realm of the dead.

Thus ended the service of Hercules to King Eurystheus. But the hero was waiting for new feats and new tests.
