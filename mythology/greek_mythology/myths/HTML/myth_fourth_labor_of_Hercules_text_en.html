Both in summer and in autumn, when the harvest ripens in the fields, the peasants who lived at the foot of Mount Erimanth looked anxiously around their plots in the morning and each time they found traces of terrible devastation: the land was dug up, the crops were trampled down and uprooted, and the fruits in the orchards crushed by someone's brute force.

People said that on the slopes of the mountain, covered with a dense oak forest, a wild boar settled, which at night descended from the mountain and devastated the fields. But his fangs and hooves were so terrible that no one dared to go into the forest and kill the beast.

And for the fourth time Koprey appeared to Hercules and gave him another order from Eurystheus: to catch the Erymanthian boar.

“Catching the Erymanthian boar is not a tricky thing,” Hercules said to Iolaus when Koprey left, “but it’s not easy to get to him: centaurs block the approaches to Erimanth, and it’s harder to get through the possessions of these unbridled, lawless half-humans, half-horses, than to catch some wild boar ".

"Where did these centaurs come from?" Iolaus asked.

"I tell you, friend, that I know about them ... Once upon a time there lived the king of the Lapith tribe Ixion," Hercules began the story. "Ixion was the first among mortals to desecrate himself with kindred blood. Not wishing to pay Dioinea, his father-in-law, a ransom for his wife, he pushed him A pit full of hot coals. A terrible death was accepted by Dioineus. For cleansing Ixion turned to Zeus himself, and Zeus not only cleansed the killer, but also brought him closer to his throne. There, on Olympus, the mortal Ixion began to seek the love of Hera, the divine wife of the greatest of To find out the limit of the dishonor of Ixion, Zeus gave the appearance of Hera to Tuche-Nephele, who had stopped over Olympus. It was from this lawless union of the imaginary Hera and Ixion that the lawless centaurs came.By the verdict of Zeus, Ixion was thrown into the darkest depths of Hades and forever chained to the eternally spinning wheel of fire. And the cruel, merciless centaurs, having moved from Thessaly to the north of the Peloponnese, still live near Mount Erimanth. Among all this lawless brotherhood, only the wise centaur Chiron, who possesses the gift of immortality, and the hospitable centaur Foul are friendly to people, and the rest are just waiting for an opportunity to trample anyone who walks on two legs with their hooves. Here I have to fight with them. "to trample with their hooves anyone who walks on two legs. Here I have to fight with them. "to trample under the hooves of anyone who walks on two legs. Here I have to fight with them. "

"We have to fight," Iolaus corrected Hercules.

"No, my friend, you will have to stay," Hercules objected. "I can handle the centaurs alone."

For many days Hercules walked to Mount Erymanth to carry out the fourth order of Eurystheus. Several times he saw from afar herds of centaurs racing madly, as if in a fit of madness. Some gods know on what day of the journey Hercules saw a cave, in front of which an elderly centaur was standing extremely calmly and calmly.

"Who are you, daredevil, not afraid to wander into our domain?" The centaur asked.

"I am a royal hunter," Hercules replied. "The king ordered me to get a wild boar that lives on this mountain. Can you tell me how to find it?"

"Oh, this boar is very annoying for us, the inhabitants of this mountain. I will show you his trail. But first, be my guest. My name is Foul. I, unlike my brethren, respect the law of hospitality. Come into my cave, I will pour you a cup of good wine. "

Hercules accepted the invitation of Fola, and, calling his name, entered the centaur's dwelling. Immediately a huge wineskin was opened and the bowls raised. The fragrance of the wondrous wine spread far away. Other centaurs smelled this fragrance and descended to the cave of Fol. They were terribly angry with Fool for opening a wineskin for a man with the coveted wine. Threatening Heracles with death, they demanded that he leave the cave and surrender.

Hercules was not afraid. From the depths of the cave, he began to hurl burning brands from the hearth at the centaurs. "Call Chiron! Chiron here!" Shouted the centaurs. Hercules was surprised: is the wise Chiron among this herd? He left the cave to greet the noble centaur, and at the same moment stones flew at the son of Zeus, which were thrown at him by half-horse-half-people, mad with anger.

What was left for Hercules to do? He drew his bow striking without a miss and began to shoot arrows at the centaurs poisoned by the blood of the Lernaean hydra.

One by one, dead centaurs fell to the ground. The Cloud-Nefela took pity on her children, and it poured down a torrential rain. It is easy for four-legged centaurs to jump on wet soil, but Hercules slipped, and for the first time his arrow flew past the target. The hero aimed at the fiercest and strongest centaur, but hit an old, gray-haired one standing at a distance, who did not take part in the battle. The centaurs heard the woeful groan of their wounded comrade and fled. The battle is over. Everything calmed down, only the wounded old centaur was barely audible groaning. Foul, hiding there, came out of the cave.

"Gods! It's Chiron!" He shouted when he saw the wounded centaur.

"Chiron? - asked Hercules. - Oh, what have I done! I was so eager to meet you, the wisest of the wise, I so wanted to listen to your speeches. And now - I see you dying, and I am your killer!"

"An involuntary killer," Chiron replied, "and I absolve you of the blame. Only one thing is bad: I am the son of Cronus and the nymph Filyra, a centaur who absorbed immortality with his mother's milk. I cannot die, but the poison of the Lernaean hydra, which the arrow was impregnated with, that wounded me, brings me unbearable suffering. Will they last forever? Gods, well, let me die! I return you my immortality and I pray you: take my life and let my voluntary death be the guarantee of the release of the just titan Prometheus. There is no guilt for Prometheus ! Great Zeus! Calm down your unrighteous anger! "

These were the last words of the wise Chiron. The ground shook. Zeus heard Chiron's prayer. Peace spread over the face of the wounded and his breathing stopped.

Foul and Hercules carried the body of the dead Chiron into the cave. Foul took an arrow from his wound. “How does this little piece of wood strike to death?” Foul asked. "Caution!" - shouted Hercules. But it was too late: Foul dropped an arrow, and it stuck in his leg. The centaur opened his mouth to cry out in pain, but without even gasping, he fell down dead.

Hercules carried the killed centaurs into the cave, filled it with a large stone, like a tomb, and headed into the thicket of the Erymanthian forest.

He tracked down the boar without difficulty, caught it, took it to Mycenae and showed it to Koprey. Eurystheus did not even want to look at the prey of Hercules. As soon as he heard the roar of the Erymanthian boar, the cowardly king hid in a large copper vessel for water.

Hercules laughed, ordered the boar to roast and arrange a treat for the people.
