A whole year after the destruction of the Lerne Hydra, Hercules and Yolai enjoyed peace in Mycenae, hunting and competing. When the year passed, he came to Heracle Koprey.

"Listen to The New Order of King Euryspheus," he told Heraclu. Farmers call it Kerinia, after the city near which it was first seen. Many tried to catch her, but, barely seeing people, the doe in the blink of an eye hides in an impenetrable forest. Bring this doe alive to King Euryspheus. For the winner of the Nemei Lion and the Lerne Hydra, it will be a simple fun."

With that, Kopray left.

Hercules thought. "Catching a Kerine doe is harder than defeating a Nemei lion and destroying the Lerne Hydra," he told Iolai. She is the sacred animal of the goddess-hunter Artemis. That's why Euryspheus ordered to catch the doe, but not to kill her. He is afraid of Artemis's wrath. Get ready, Yolai on a long journey. We will follow this order of the Euryspheus."

And Hercules and Iolai went to the wild mountains of Arcadia. Neither his heavy club, nor bow with poisonous arrows Hercules did not take, but brought with him a strong axe and a sharp knife.

The impregnable mountain steeps of Arcadia, overgrown with impenetrable forest, were the main obstacle to faithful friends. They cut through the gaps, felled trees and threw them over deep precipices, punched the steps on the sheer cliffs, rising higher and higher. Snow avalanches showered them with icy dust, storm clouds were falling right over their heads...

Once, when the first rays of the rising sun were painted with the soft pink color of the snow of the mountain top, Hercules saw a doe with golden horns. "Look, here it is, Kerynian doe," Whispered Hercules.

Lan was so close that it would have been easy to kill her, but they had to take her alive. Heraclu seemed to look at him with a sneer: try, catch me, catch up if you can.

But it was only necessary to stir Heraclu, as the doe rushed away faster than the wind. How could a hero miss her? What labors and hardships were worth finding this doe! Hercules chased her. All day he was chasing the elusive animal, then the second, the third... Yolai was somewhere far behind. And the doe, not knowing fatigue, rushed through the mountains, across the plains, jumped over the abyss, swam over the rivers, running further and further north - to the country of the Hyperboreans. At the source of the river Istr the lan finally stopped and looked straight into the eyes of her pursuer. Only this time I saw Hercules in her eyes reproach.

Long stood against each other - a mighty hero and a fast-moving animal. Then Hercules took a step, another, coming closer and closer to the doe. Now they are separated by the distance of the outstretched hand: it remains only to grab the doe by the horns. But the doe, jumping to the side, rushed again, like a bowed arrow, now back to the south.

And again began the chase across the plains, the woods. Hercules guessed: the doe aspires to her native mountains of Arcadia, under the protection of his patroness Artemis. He was desperate to give Artemis a sacred animal, but he could not stop chasing the son of Thunderbird.

Behind Thrace, Thessaly, Beotia, and the chase continued. The mountains of Arcadia were very close when the doe subdued Heraclu: maybe the forces left her, or maybe she realized that it is impossible to escape from fate. He tied her evil doe, put it on his shoulders, and went slowly to Mycenae.

Suddenly on the forest path appeared before him a beautiful maiden in a short light tunic, with a hunting bow in his hands and a quiver behind his shoulders. Her face was angry, her eyes sparkling with indignation. In a commanding gesture, she stopped Hercules and said, "Oh greedy mortals! Don't you have enough roads and fields in the wide valleys? Why are you breaking the silence of my protected forest? What's wrong with you, man, this defenseless doe?"

Hercules recognized the beautiful maiden - Artemis-hunter.

"Don't be angry with me, goddess!" he replied to her. King Euryspheus ordered me to catch keraney doe, and I serve him at the will of the almighty zeus. So I'm here because that's what zevs wants. Whether you want it, goddess, or not, people will come to these heights sooner or later. It's so beautiful, you can see the air here, it's clear, and the man himself, rising here, will be cleaner and better."

The look of the goddess softened. She went up to the bound doe, tenderly patted her, and said, "Well, Hercules, go your way. I'm not going to take your booty away from you. And you, my friend, will soon come back to me!"

Arriving in Mycenae, Hercules, at the special desire of the Euryspheus, showed him the Kerine doe - the doe cowardly king was not afraid. "Take it yourself, Hercules. You can fry it and eat it. I don't need this doe," Eurysphey said.

Hercules remembered the words of Artemis: "Soon you will come back to me!"
