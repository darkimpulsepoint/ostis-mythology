Medusa Gorgon appeared in nightmares to more than one generation of noble children who were brought up on ancient myths. Still: impenetrable scales, huge hands with steel claws, long sharp fangs, hissing poisonous snakes instead of hair. And for dessert - a chilling look that turns into a stone statue anyone who dares to look into her eyes.
However, Medusa the Gorgon was not always a chthonic nightmare. Her parents were the gods of the stormy sea and the abyss, and she herself was born a lovely sea maiden. Poseidon passionately desired the beauty, and, wanting to escape from his encroachments, she rushed to the temple of Athena. However, the cunning lord of the seas turned into a bird and took possession right in the temple of the warrior goddess. The angry Athena turned the unfortunate woman into a monstrous monster.
In despair, the girl decided to hide from people on an island lost in the ocean. And she could have lived there for many years, if not for the visit of Perseus. King Polydect, wanting to marry his mother, sent the hero to certain death, ordering to kill Medusa the gorgon. However, the head of the island of Serif did not take into account the importance of family ties. His half-brother and sister, Hermes and Athena, came to the aid of the hero. The god of eloquence gave Perseus a sharp knife, the goddess of wisdom - a shield polished to a shine. In addition, they told him how to defeat Medusa.
 Armed with this gift, Perseus arrived at the gorgons. Rising into the air on winged sandals, he was able to cut off the head of the mortal Medusa, one of the three sisters of the gorgons, looking at the reflection on the polished copper shield of Athena - after all, Medusa's gaze turned all life into stone. Perseus hid from the sisters of Medusa with the help of an invisibility cap, hiding the trophy in his back bag.
During this fight, Medusa was pregnant with Poseidon. From the headless body of Medusa, her children from Poseidon came out with a stream of blood - the giant Chrysaor (the father of the three-body Geryon) and the winged horse Pegasus. From drops of blood that fell into the sands of Libya, poisonous snakes appeared and destroyed everything living in it (according to Lucan, these were the so-called Libyan snakes: asp, amphisbene, ammodite and basilisk). Local legend says that corals emerged from a stream of blood that spilled into the ocean.
Athena gave Asclepius the blood that flowed from the veins of the Gorgon Medusa. The blood that flowed from the left side brought death, and from the right side it was used by Asclepius to save people.
According to another version, Medusa was born by Gaia and killed by Athena during a gigantomachy. According to Eugemer, Athena killed her. In imitation of the stings of the Gorgon, Athena invented the double aulos.
