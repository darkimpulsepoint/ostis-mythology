From the day Prince Eurystheus was born, he was surrounded by care and affection. True, nature gave him neither intelligence, nor strength, nor courage, but she gave him no small power. When Sfenel died, still young Eurystheus inherited the power of his father and became the king of all Argolis.

Surrounded by a crowd of courtiers, Eurystheus haughtily received Hercules. “By the oath of Zeus,” he said, “I have been entrusted with power over all of Argolis and, above all, over all the descendants of Perseus, among whom I am the eldest by birth. Everyone serves me as best he can. The gods gave you strength, you will serve me with strength. There is a glorious temple of Zeus in Nemea in our land, but recently pilgrims no longer visit it with the same zeal Nemean grove. I command you to cleanse the land of Nemea from this uninvited guest. How you get rid of this monster is up to you. But know that the sword and spear will hardly help you, for this lion, born of Typhon and the Echidna, is reputed to be invulnerable". Hercules listened silently to King Eurystheus, only nodded his head in agreement.

On the same day, leaving Iolaus in Mycenae, Hercules went to Nemea to accomplish his first feat - to kill the Nemean lion.

The land of Nemea met Hercules with silence and desolation: only weeds grew in the fields, the vineyards dried up. So great was the fear of the monstrous lion that the inhabitants of the city were afraid to leave their homes. Hercules tried to find out the way to the lion's den, but heard only one answer: "The lion will find you himself as soon as you enter the forest." People did not believe that a mortal, no matter how powerful a hero he was, could defeat a terrible beast.

For a long time Hercules searched for the lion's den along the wooded slopes and deaf ravines. Only in the evening, hearing a formidable growl emanating from a gloomy cave, Hercules realized: the hour of the duel with the monster had come.

Slowly, angrily moving his eyes and with force whipping himself with his tail on the sides, a huge lion emerged from the cave. Immediately, three arrows of Hercules sang in the air and bounced off the monster's skin, hard as a bronze shell. The lion crouched down, preparing for a fatal jump, but the son of Zeus managed to get ahead of him: as lightning flashed the heavy club of Hercules and its crushing blow fell right into the head of the beast. The lion fell, but immediately got up and threw himself on the chest of Hercules. The mighty hands of Hercules closed on the shaggy lion's neck, squeezed, and released only when the lion was already dead.

The lion's carcass was so large that Hercules did not want to carry it to Mycenae. He tore off the lion's skin along with his head, threw off the old skin of the Kiferon lion, which he had worn since his early youth, and put on a new skin of the Nemean lion, which was invulnerable to spears and arrows.

People scattered screaming at the sight of Hercules with a grinning lion's mouth on his head, and King Eurystheus, huddled in the far corner of the throne room, shouted: "Go away! Go away! And henceforth do not dare approach my palace! My orders will be conveyed to you by the herald!"
