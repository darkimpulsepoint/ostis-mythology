And again he ordered Eurystheus to set off on a long journey, this time to the north - to Thrace. "You must take the horses from the Thracian king Diomedes and drive them to Mycenae, - said Koprey, - this is the new order of the king."

Hercules was indignant: "I am not a robber, not a thief! Fighting evil is my lot, and Eurystheus makes me commit an evil deed!"

"Calm down, Hercules! By abducting horses you will not stain your honor, for these horses are cannibals. Diomedes feeds them with human meat, and to stop this blasphemy is a godly deed," said Koprey and left.

I had to obey Hercules. With a heavy heart, he set off on the road, deciding that the path to Thrace was long, and he would have time to think about what to do.

Hercules came first to the seven-fold Thebes, the city in which he was born, visited the old king Creon and his former friends. Then he moved on through Thermopylae to Thessaly. Here he was warmly received by Admet, the king of the city of Fera. He ordered to prepare a room in the palace for Hercules and treat the guest well, but for some reason he himself refused to take part in the meal.

Hercules did not know that on this day the house of Admet suffered a great grief: the wife of Admet, Queen Alkesta, died prematurely. And it happened like this ...

When Apollo killed the monstrous serpent Python, spawned by Gaia, Zeus ordered the radiant god to serve a mortal for a whole year and thus atone for the filth of shed blood. Apollo came to King Admet and grazed his flocks for a whole year. Happiness came to the king's house: the fields gave a bountiful harvest, the herds multiplied. But the most precious of all the riches was the young queen Alkesta, whom Apollo helped Admetus get to be his wife.

Alcesta's father, the ruler Iolka Pelius, announced that he would give his daughter only to the one who came for the bride in a chariot drawn by a lion and a bear. Apollo tamed the wild beasts - they obediently harnessed to the chariot and took Admet to Alcesta's father. Alkesta became the wife of Admet.

There was no happier married couple in all Hellas than Admet and Alkesta. When the service life of Apollo, the god of light, ended, he wanted to make another gift to Admet. At the request of Apollo Moira, the goddess of fate, who hold in their hands the thread of every human life, they agreed to postpone Admet's death hour if there is a person who wants to voluntarily leave this life instead of Admet.

And then came the day when the death demon Thanatos came for Admet. Moira was asked: "Who wants to die instead of Admet? .." But neither friends, nor faithful servants, nor elderly parents - no one wanted to part with their life and die for another.

Then the beautiful Alkesta said: "Admet! I will gladly go to the kingdom of the dead instead of you. All the same, I cannot live in this world without you. Live, Admet, but never bring another woman into our house. And now let Thanatos come for me. ". Immediately a black shadow fell on the queen's face, and her breath stopped.

They dressed Alcesta in clean white clothes, laid her on a stretcher and carried her body to the royal tomb. For a long time, her husband, her children and close relatives stood at the body of Alkesta, looking for the last time at the face of his dearest person. Then they closed the stone doors of the royal tomb and left.

And Hercules at this time, in a cool, clean room, was eating exquisite food alone. The old servant who served him wine looked at him sternly and sadly.

“Why are you looking at me so sternly?” Hercules asked. “Your master has accepted me as a friend, but you look at me as an enemy.” But the old servant shook his head reproachfully and said: "It is not good to laugh and drink when there is grief in the house."

Hercules was surprised: "Woe? What happened in this happy house?" And he heard in response that Admet's wife had died, and at this hour Thanatos must take her shadow to the abode of Hades. Then Hercules decided on an unprecedented business: to snatch Alkesta from the hands of the demon of death.

Night had already fallen to the ground. Hercules, unnoticed, left the palace and quietly made his way to the royal tomb. There he hid behind a tree and waited. And then the flapping of the black wings of Thanatos was heard, who flew to the tomb to drink the sacrificial blood and carry the pale shadow of the deceased to the underworld. Hercules prepared for the battle with the very demon of death.

As soon as Thanatos sank to the ground, Hercules grabbed him with his mighty hands, and a merciless struggle began between them: Hercules was strangling Thanatos, Thanatos was strangling Hercules. The cold of death blows from the demon's wings, the forces of Hercules leave, but Thanatos also weakens, wheezing with an intercepted throat.

Stronger than the demon of death was the son of Zeus. Thanatos pleaded: "Let me go, mortal! What ransom do you want for my freedom!" "Give life back to Alkeste," Hercules replied. And the half-strangled Thanatos croaked: "I agree ..".

Admet sat alone in his empty house. All his happiness was stolen by Thanatos. What could be more difficult for him than the loss of his beloved wife. "It would be better if I died with her," thought Admet, "our shadows would cross the underground rivers together, and Hades would get two shadows instead of one."

Admet's sorrowful thoughts were interrupted by Hercules who suddenly entered. With him came a woman, covered from head to toe with a thick veil.

"Enough, Admet," said Hercules, "rejoice, it's enough for you to indulge in sorrow. Look what woman I brought you! I got her for you in a duel. She will make you happy again."

"Take away, Hercules, this woman from my house," Admet replied. "I promised Alkeste that I would never take another wife for myself."

Then Hercules removed the veil from the woman, and Admet saw Alcesta. He rushed to her, but stopped in fright: after all, he himself closed the doors of her tomb ...

"Do not be afraid," Hercules reassured him. "She is alive, Thanatos gave her to me, and I return her to you. Live and be happy for many years!"

"Oh, the great son of Zeus! - exclaimed Admet. - You have returned to me the joy of life! How can I thank you? Remain forever an honored guest in my house! I will command in all my possessions to celebrate your victory!"

"Thank you for your hospitality," Hercules replied. "I would have stayed with you for another day or two. But ... Oh, those horses of Diomedes!"

The fun replaced the sadness. In Admet's house, they took off their mourning clothes and feasted merrily, and Hercules was already walking on, pleased that he had managed to make Admet happy.

Having reached the sea, Hercules boarded a ship and reached the coast of Thrace by sea. On the way, he learned a lot about Diomedes' horses. When an unfamiliar ship approached the Thracian shores, Diomedes sent his servants to invite visitors to visit. He generously treated them and boasted about four of his wonderful horses, said that no one can bridle them, and therefore they are chained to stalls with strong chains. Of course, the guests expressed a desire to see the extraordinary horses. Then the cruel king took guests to the stables and gave them to his favorites to be eaten.

Now all the doubts of Hercules were dispelled: ridding the world of cannibalistic horses and a bloodthirsty king was a deed worthy of a hero.

Hercules came to the palace of Diomedes and demanded that the king give him the horses voluntarily. But Diomedes sent a whole army against Hercules. The hero easily scattered this army, and gave Diomedes himself to be devoured by his own man-eating horses. Then he loaded the horses onto the ship and delivered them safely to King Eurystheus. Eurystheus ordered to take the horses to the Lyceum mountains, and release them in the forest. There, wild animals were torn to pieces by man-eating horses.
