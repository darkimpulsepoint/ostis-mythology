Six times Hercules had already returned to Mycenae and, by order of Ephrisfeus, set off on a journey full of dangers. He did six glorious deeds: he killed the Nemean lion, destroyed the Lernaean hydra, caught the Kerinean doe, defeated the Erymanthian boar, drove the Stimphalian birds out of Hellas, cleared the stables of King Augean in one day.

Days dragged on for days, and Eurystheus seemed to have forgotten about the existence of Hercules. Once a messenger came to Hercules from Jason, the son of the Iolkian king, who was deprived of his power over the city of Iolcus by his relative Pelias.

“My lord Jason,” the envoy said, “is gathering the most brave heroes of Hellas to go with them by sea to the end of the world, to Colchis, for the skin of a golden fleece. The king of Colchis, Eet, does not rightfully own this rune. - a matter of valor and honor. Do you accept Iason's invitation? "

"Damn this service to the cowardly Eurystheus!" Hercules cried. "I'm not a slave to him! I'm going with you!"

So Hercules came to the Thessalian Iolk. The best sons of Hellas have already gathered there to set off on a sturdy fast ship called "Argo" to the kingdom of Eetus.

When the "Argo" passed the middle of the way to distant Colchis, a misfortune happened: Gilas, the youngest among the Argonauts and a great friend of Hercules, disappeared.

For a long time Hercules was looking for his favorite on the inhospitable shore, where the Argonauts landed in order to replenish the supply of fresh water, but he never found him. Saddened by the loss of a friend, Hercules refused to sail further with the Argonauts and returned to Mycenae.

And there a new order from Eurystheus awaited him: to tame the Cretan bull and deliver it to Argolis. This bull once sailed to the island of Crete, and the Cretan king Minos promised the god of the seas Poseidon to sacrifice the bull to him24. But Minos liked the snow-white bull with golden horns so much that the king kept him for himself, and sacrificed another bull to Poseidon. The god of the sea was angry and sent fury to the golden-horned handsome man. A mad bull escaped from the stall, fled from the royal court and became a thunderstorm for the entire island.

Having received the order of Eurystheus, Hercules went to the seashore and boarded a Phoenician ship heading for Crete.

It was the intrigues of Hera or the dictates of fate, but as soon as the ship went out into the open sea, a fierce storm flew in. For a long time the ship rushed among the raging waves, until it crashed on the shore of a foreign unfamiliar country.

Here trees grew that looked like bunches of large feathers: thick stems emerged right from the trunk, on which leaves swayed, so large that a person could hide under everyone.

Hercules and his surviving companions walked along the coast along the hot yellow sand and came to a large city by the sea. "You are in Egypt," said the inhabitants of the city, "and Egypt is ruled by the great Busiris, a mighty and formidable king."

Hercules asked to take him to the king. But as soon as he entered the palace, he was seized and chained.

"You came on time, stranger," the ruler of Egypt told him. "Today is a holiday in my country, and I will sacrifice you and your companions to our gods."

"The gods do not accept human sacrifice," Hercules objected to him.

Busiris laughed: "Not one hundred years in Egypt they sacrifice all foreigners, and the gods have not yet become angry with us. We, the Egyptians, have surpassed all nations in piety, and it is not for you to teach us."

When Hercules was brought to the altar and a priest in a long white robe raised a sacrificial knife over him, the mighty son of Zeus easily broke the chains with which he was chained. With a piece of chain, he hit the priest, threw the royal guard, then took away the sword from Busiris and stabbed the cruel king.

Struck by the strength of the hero, the Egyptians did not dare to touch him. Hercules freed his companions and hurried with them to the harbor. There they found a ship that took them to Crete for a modest fee.

The very feat for which he was sent was not difficult for Hercules. Having met with a mad Cretan bull, Hercules jumped on his back, wrapped a chain around his horns and pulled it tight. The bull tried in vain to throw off an unexpected burden from his back - Hercules sat firmly, squeezing his ribs more and more with his legs. Lowing pitifully, the bull ran to the sea, rushed into the waves and swam. At sea, the rage left him, and he became as meek as a working ox on the field. Guided by the hand of Hercules, the bull swam across the sea to the Peloponnese.

Hercules himself took the bull to the barnyard of Eurystheus. But the shepherds could not keep him in the stable. The bull broke free and went for a walk throughout the Peloponnese, not giving in to anyone, until he was caught by young Theseus, the son of the Athenian king Aegeus.
