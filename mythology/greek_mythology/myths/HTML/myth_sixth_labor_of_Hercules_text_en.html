The Stimphalian birds were the last offspring of monsters in the Peloponnese, and since the power of Eurystheus did not extend beyond the Peloponnese, Hercules decided that his service to the king was over.

But the mighty power of Hercules did not allow him to live in idleness. He longed for exploits and was even delighted when Koprey appeared to him.

"Eurystheus," said the herald, "commands you to cleanse the stables of the Elid king Augean from the manure in one day."

"You would be better off entrusting this business," Iolaus grumbled. "By the way, you have a good name."

“You can't insult the herald,” Hercules interrupted him sternly. “I don't think Eurystheus just wanted to offend me by forcing me to clean up the manure. Something else is hiding here. We’ll see.”

Augeus really owned countless herds of fine horses. They grazed in the fertile valley of the Alpheus, and the stables, which had not been cleaned in years, were full of dung.

Hercules came to Elis and said to Augius: "If you give me a tenth of your horses, I will clear the stables in one day."

Augeas laughed: he thought that the stables could not be cleaned at all. "A tenth of my herds are yours, Hercules," agreed Augeas, "but if tomorrow morning all the stables are clean."

Hercules demanded that they give him a shovel, and Augeas ordered to bring it to the hero. "How long will you have to work with this shovel!" - he said. "Only one day," Hercules answered and went to the coast of Alpheus.

For half a day, Hercules worked hard with a shovel. He dammed the river bed and led its waters directly to the royal stables. By the evening, the rapid stream of Alfey carried away all the manure from the stables, and together with the manure both stalls, feeders, and even dilapidated walls.

"Do not seek, king, - said Hercules, - I cleared your stables not only from manure, but also from everything that has long rotted away. I did more than I promised. Now you give me what you promised."

Augeas was greedy, he did not want to give up his horses. He ordered his two nephews to ambush Hercules and kill him. How could two mere mortals cope with the son of Zeus! And the ambush set up by them did not help - the nephews of Avgius fell from the hand of Hercules.

Great was Hercules' indignation at the treachery of the Elide king. "It is impossible, punishing the instrument of the crime, to leave the culprit unpunished," thought Hercules. "Let people know that my vocation is in cleansing the earth from all lawlessness in both animal and human form."

Having dispersed the palace guards, Hercules killed Avgius in an honest duel. The inhabitants of Elis began to ask the victor to take the throne of Avgius and become their king. But Hercules indignantly rejected this request. “I slayed Avgius,” he said, “not in order to take possession of his kingdom. There is a son of Avgius, who has not done anything wrong before the gods. Let him rule over you. Before I leave, I want to make a grateful sacrifice to Olympian Zeus and to establish games in his honor. Let from now on and until the end of centuries, athletes from all over Greece gather here for competitions every four years. And let, while the Olympic Games, peace reign on earth. "
