The cosmogonic myth is the myth of creation, the myth of the origin of the cosmos from chaos, the main initial plot of most mythologies. It begins with a description of chaos (emptiness), the absence of order in the universe, the interaction of the primordial elements. Serves to explain the origin of the world and life on Earth.
