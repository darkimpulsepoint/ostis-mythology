The Norns (Old Norse: norn, plural: nornir) are deities in Norse mythology responsible for shaping the course of human destinies.

In the Völuspá attested by Snorri Sturluson, the three primary Norns Urðr (Wyrd), Verðandi, and Skuld draw water from their sacred well to nourish the tree at the center of the cosmos and prevent it from rot.[2] These three Norns are described as powerful maiden giantesses (Jotuns) whose arrival from Jötunheimr ended the golden age of the gods. The Norns are also described as maidens of Mögþrasir in the Vafþrúðnismál.

Beside the three Norns tending Yggdrasill, pre-Chrisitian Scandinavians attested to Norns who visit a newborn child in order to determine the person's future. These Norns could be malevolent or benevolent: the former causing tragic events in the world while the latter were kind and protective.
