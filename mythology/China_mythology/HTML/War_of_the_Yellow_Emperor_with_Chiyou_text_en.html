In the eyes of some people, Chi-yu is an evil heavenly deity, but in reality it is the name of a tribe of brave giants.

This tribe lived in the south, and its people were considered the descendants of the emperor Yan-di. Ancient books say: “Chi-yu had eighty-one or seventy-two brothers, each of them was terrible and unusual, had a copper head, an iron forehead, an animal body, cow hooves, four eyes and six arms, could speak in a human way. ", They also say that a strong and sharp horn grew on Chi-yu's head, and when the hair behind the ears stood up, they resembled swords and tridents, some believe that Chi-yu had eight arms and eight legs, - it is said everywhere differently. In general, we can say that Chi-yu belonged to an unusual tribe that stood somewhere between gods and people, who, according to legends, are closest to oxen, but one can also believe that these are the descendants of Yan-di with a human body and the head of an ox.

It is not only Chi-yu's appearance that is amazing, but what he ate is even more amazing. His usual food was sand, stones, and pieces of iron. He was skilled at making a variety of weapons: pointed spears, sturdy and sharp tridents, giant axes, sturdy shields, light bows and arrows. He did all this with his own hands. In addition, he was endowed with divine power that far surpassed that of humans, and this is worth mentioning right away. Apparently, possessing exceptional abilities and great endurance, he could not remain meek and restrained, and he had a daring idea to take the throne from the respected Supreme Emperor and sit on the throne himself. When the Yellow Emperor gathered the good and evil spirits of the Celestial Empire on Mount Xitaishan, Chi-yu also appeared to show humility, but who knows if he had any thought to reveal the strength of the enemy. He looked, came back, figured it out once and thought that although Huang-di had a lot of strength, it’s not a matter of collecting more. And if you really take up arms, then it is still unknown who will win.

Before starting the struggle for the throne of Huang-di, he first decided to take away the throne of his ancestor Yan-di, to strengthen his power, and then it will be seen. Indeed, he raised his brothers, whose hands had been itching for a long time, and, leading the crowd of ghosts and evil spirits of mountains, rivers, trees and rocks, suddenly attacked the old god. The sun god Yan-di possessed divine power and had a warrior-god under his hands, but, firstly, he was not ready to fight back - after all, Chi-yu attacked so suddenly and brazenly, and secondly, the humane Yan-di was afraid, that the war would bring misfortune to the people, and therefore gave in to Yug Chi-yu and fled north to Jolu. So easily, without difficulty, the southern throne was in the hands of Chi-yu. Having taken possession of it, Chi-yu, being a descendant of Yan-di, "correcting names and speaking of obedience," called himself Yan-di. The plans of this self-proclaimed Yan-di were great and extensive, he did not rest on the insignificant position of the ruler of one part of the sky, his ultimate goal was still to take the throne of the main supreme ruler - the Yellow Emperor. We have already said above that the Miao people living in the south were a descendant of the Yellow Emperor and were famous for their bravery, and Chi-yu, in order to replenish his troops and carry out his risky plans, just stopped at this people. In every way he incited the Miao people to go with him against the Yellow Emperor, and in the end he ensured that this brave people, skilled in war, followed him.

Realizing that time was favorable for him, Chi-yu led his army: copper-headed and iron-headed brothers, brave and warlike people of Miao, evil spirits of mountains, rivers, trees and rocks and all evil spirits, and, crushing everything in his path, approached the famous ancient battlefield - Zholu (in the modern county Zholu, Hebei province).

And Yan-di, who fled there, seeing that Chi-yu came from the south to fight in the north, was forced to gather his army and fight him in Chzholu. But Yan-di could not resist the power of Chi-yu and sent a messenger to the Yellow Emperor with a request for help. Huang Di lived at this time serenely in the palaces and gardens of Kunlun. Suddenly he heard that Chi-yu had moved a large army and attacked Chjola, where his brother Yan-di had fled. Jolu was under the control of the Yellow Emperor, so it became clear to everyone that Chi-yu wanted to reclaim his throne from the supreme ruler. One can imagine how frightened and angry the Yellow Emperor was. Ancient books say: "At first, with speeches about humanity and duty, he tried to reason with Chi-yu, but the stubborn Chi-yu did not give in to this, and he had no choice but to start a war with him."

There was no other war equal to this in cruelty. In the army of Chi-yu, as we said above, there were about eighty of his copper-headed brothers with iron foreheads, the Miao people, evil spirits of rivers, mountains, trees and rocks, and other werewolves and devils. In the army of the Yellow Emperor, besides the gods and evil spirits of all four sides, there were all sorts of animals: simple bears and pale yellow ones with a head similar to a horse, Sichuan bears, leopards, predatory animals like leopards, jaguars and tigers; it is possible that some peoples were on his side on the ground. Indeed, they gathered, as they say, worthy opponents, no one thought to concede to another. And since Chi-yu was named after Yan-di, some people believed that there was a war not between the Yellow Emperor and Chi-yu, but between Huang-di and Yan-di. The result is sheer confusion.

When the battle began, it became clear that the advantage was on Chi-yu's side. True, Huang-di had a huge army of wild animals, which swiftly attacked enemy positions, on his side were good and evil spirits of all four sides and some peoples, but he could not be a real enemy of Chi-yu, and his army suffered in a row multiple defeats. The situation has become rather complicated.

Once, when the enemies met in the field in a fierce battle, Chi-yu, having surrounded Huang-di's army, with some unknown sorcery, let such a thick fog over the sky and earth that it was impossible to make out where is north, where is south, where is east, where west. In this endless white fog, the copper-headed and iron-fronted warriors Chi-yu and he himself with a horn on his head looked even more terrible. They appeared from the fog, then disappeared, then appeared, then seemed to drown; bumping into people - they chopped them down, and those whom they saw - were killed to death. In the army of Huang-di, horses whinnied plaintively, people shouted, tigers hid and wolves ran.

- Forward! At the enemy! - shouted the Yellow Emperor loudly, standing on the war chariot and belligerently swinging his sword.

- Forward! At the enemy! - echoed him the good and evil spirits of all four sides, and their cries merged into a single powerful cry.

Tigers and bears growled, everyone wanted to quickly escape from the encirclement of a terrible, dangerous fog.

Forward! Forward! However, they fought for a very long time, rushing here and there, but still remained in captivity of the boundless white fog.

The good and evil spirits of the four sides could not do anything, and Huang-di did not know the way out; it was as if not a fog, but a huge blanket of white linen, covering both the sky and the whole earth.

Just as the Yellow Emperor furrowed his brows in despondency, one of his dignitaries named Feng-hou, a small, unusually intelligent old man, was sitting on the war chariot, slightly closing his eyes, and seemed to be dozing. When Huang-di asked him why he was quietly dozing during the most intense time of the battle, Feng-hou suddenly opened his eyes and clearly said:

- Am I dreaming? - I'm thinking of a way out!

Indeed, this little old man was thinking how to break out of the fog. Why does the Big Dipper's bucket always point north, regardless of time and any changes? Now, if you could invent such a thing so that wherever you turned, east or west, it would always point in one direction. And since one direction is known, then it will be possible to determine the other three - won't that be the solution? He thought, thought - and suddenly came up with a wonderful way out. He exerted all his extraordinary powers and abilities and made a "chariot pointing to the south." Ahead, on a chariot, stood a small iron man with an arm extended just to the south. Thanks to this, the Yellow Emperor was able to withdraw his troops from the continuous fog.

Deity of the constellation Ursa Major, who later became the patron saint of literature. Ulyansky. As we said above, there were ghosts in the Chi-yu army, and the evil spirits of mountains, rivers, trees and rocks and all sorts of werewolves and devils - all these evil spirits could make amazing sounds that fascinated people. Hearing these sounds, people became helpless and stupid, lost their minds, went where these sounds attracted them, and became a victim of werewolves and evil spirits. The spirits could be divided into approximately three types: ghosts of chimei with a human face, an animal body and four legs; Shenhui spirits - also with a human face, an animal body, but with only one hand and one leg, emitting sounds like yawning; still others - evil spirits of mountains, rivers, trees and rocks - resembled three-year-old children with a red-black body, long ears, red eyes, black as a crow's wing, shiny long hair: they loved, imitating human speech, to lure people. All three types of evil spirits were harmful, and the troops of Huang Di were lost because of them for so long that it had a detrimental effect on the course of the battle. Only later did the Yellow Emperor learn from somewhere that although all these ghosts and evil spirits love to lure people with amazing sounds, they themselves are most afraid of the dragon's roar. Then he ordered the soldiers to take the signal horns of bull and ram and blow in them so that they heard sounds resembling the roar of a dragon. Sounds echoed over the field, then werewolves and devils from Chi-yu's army trembled, went cold, as if they were drunk or intoxicated, and could no longer show their magic and enchantment. Huang-ti's troops rushed forward and won a tiny victory.

Huang-di did indeed have a magical dragon named Ying-lun, who had two wings from birth and who lived on the southern slope of Mount Xionglitucyushan and was adept at controlling waters and rain. “Chi-yu can let in a big fog, and my Ying-lun can send a heavy downpour, but a downpour is worse than a big fog! In addition, In-lun will appear, and all the ghost and evil spirits will not be able to do their own intrigues at all. " And Huang-di sent a man to call for help Ying-lun on the battlefield.

Ying-lun, as soon as he arrived, immediately entered into battle with Chi-yu. He spread his wings, flew up and spread rain clouds on a stand. Who could have known that he had poorly installed the stand, and Chi-yu had long ago invited the spirit of the wind Feng-bo and the owner of the rain, Yu-shek, to be the first to show their strength. And now a fierce unprecedented wind and rain had already risen, it seemed that two shamans were fighting among themselves. Ying-lun already had nowhere to show his talent. A furious wind and downpour fell on the Huang-ti army, the soldiers could not even stand on their feet and fled in different directions.

The Yellow Emperor watched the battle from the top of a small mountain. He saw that Ying-lun was unable to help the cause and that all his hopes were in vain, and called for help from his daughter, who followed the army.

A spirit with a human face and an animal body (apparently, chimei). Yingan, back room. Huang-di's daughter's name was Ba, she lived in the Gun-gun gazebo on Mount Shikunipan, often wore dark clothes, was not at all beautiful and, as they say, even bald. But her body was full of intense heat, perhaps even more intense than in modern furnaces where cast iron is melted. As soon as she appeared on the battlefield, so to speak, surprisingly, at the same moment both the wind and the downpour stopped, even their traces were not visible, and a bright, hot sun shone in the sky directly overhead and it became even hotter than it was before the rain ... Seeing this, the Chi-yu brothers were horrified, and the dragon In-lun, seizing the moment, rushed forward and began to destroy the enemies. Thus, several Chi-yu brothers and part of the Miao people were killed.

However, the poor daughter of heaven Ba, having done her father a favor, perhaps because she spent too much energy or under the influence of witchcraft, could no longer ascend to heaven, but remained forever on earth. Where she settled, for a thousand li there were only light clouds and not a drop of rain fell. People who suffered from such a drought hated her and called her Hanba - Demon of Drought. People were constantly inventing tricks to drive her out. So she wandered everywhere, pursued by people, never meeting a warm welcome. Later, the grandson of the first ancestor of the Chou clan, Hou-tszi (the god of five grains, which will be discussed in the next chapter) named Shu-tszun, told Huang-di that Hanba never met a good reception, and then the Yellow Emperor ordered her to settle north of Red water - Chishui and ordered to live forever in one place and not rush everywhere. But Hanba was already accustomed to wandering among people and could not sit still. She would often sneak away, “scamper to the east and toss in the west,” and people again suffered from the drought she brought with her. But it was already much easier for people that she had a certain place. Before driving her out, they carefully dug canals, ditches and ditches, and then turned to her with a prayer: “Goddess! Go to your home north of Red Water. " They say that after such incantations, she gradually became ashamed of herself, she returned to her old house and died there.

Chi-yu possessed the ability to fly across the sky and traverse the most dangerous mountain ranges. Although he lost several brothers and part of the Miao people, he still had many warriors, he did not lose heart, and his power continued to grow. And the Yellow Emperor grieved that he had no way to deal with the evil rebels and that his soldiers had lost heart after a long battle.

Finally, he came up with a good way out - to make an unusual battle drum from a special material in order to raise the spirit of his warriors and defeat enemies.

It turns out that a wild beast, whose name was Kui, lived on Mount Liuposhan in the East Sea, he looked like a bull, but without horns, his body was ash-blue, he had only one leg. He could walk freely on the sea, and every time he went out to sea, a strong wind would immediately rise, a downpour would begin to lash. His eyes radiated a brilliant light, like the sun or the moon. When he opened his mouth, there was a roar like thunderclaps. This one-legged animal was also called shancao by the inhabitants of the Yue country. They said that he had a human face, the body of a monkey, and he could speak in a human language. Apparently, this happened due to the different transmission of the myth. To his misfortune, he liked Huang-di, he sent a man for him. The skin of the beast was flayed, dried and pulled onto a drum.

Now that the drum had appeared, only the sticks were missing. Then the Yellow Emperor remembered the thunder god Lei-sheng, who lived in Leize - the Thunder Swamp. Lei-shen, who was also called Lei-shou - Thunder Beast, was a monster with the body of a dragon and the head of a man. Often without any sadness, amused, he slapped himself on the stomach, and each clap echoed across the sky like a clap of thunder. Once the mother of Fu-si, nee Hua-dan, stepped on his trail and gave birth to Fu-si, so Lei-shen was considered one of the famous gods in heaven. However, Huang-di had to defeat the enemies, and he sent people to seize the god of thunder and without further ado killed him. Then he pulled out the largest bone from it and made a drumstick out of it.

Now there was a drum, and there was a stick. When Huang-di struck the drum made of Kui's skin with the bone of Lei-shen, a roar was heard even stronger than thunder; they say it could be heard even for five hundred li. They dragged this drum to combat positions, struck nine times in a row - and in fact the mountains hummed, the valleys responded to them, the color of the earth and sky changed, the warriors of Huang-di perked up, and Chi-yu and his warriors were scared to death. Because of fear, Chi-yu could no longer fly or walk. Under the deafening beat of the drum, the soldiers of the Yellow Emperor began to press against the army of Chi-yu and won a huge victory. Many Chi-yu brothers and Miao people were captured and killed.

This time, Chi-yu's defeat was very heavy. In fact, it turned out that there were not even half of the horses and soldiers left.

If you don't give up, then everyone will die. The warriors became agitated. Surrender is shameful, no one wanted to surrender. Someone suggested calling for help from the north of the tribe of giants Kua-fu. This advice was liked by the majority, and immediately a man was sent to the north.
