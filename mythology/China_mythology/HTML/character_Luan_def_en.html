Luan-nyao (Chinese trad. 鸞 鳥, ex. 鸾 鸟, pinyin luán niǎo) is a wonderful bird in ancient Chinese mythology, whose appearance was possible only in times of peace. In ancient China, decorative and ritual images of luan-nyao were placed on the ruler's banner, and they also painted his chariot.

The appearance of Luan-nyao resembled a rooster, the color of the feathers and the description of the voice in different sources differ, according to one version - the bird has red feathers, with a multi-colored transition, and is capable of making any sound that exists in the world; according to another version, the feathers of luan-nyao are painted in a predominantly blue-green color, and her singing is like the strum of a bell. [1] In addition, there is a description with snakes hanging from the shield-bearing head, from the chest and legs. [2]

In the poem "Yuan yu" ("Distant wandering") contained in the book "Chu tsy" ("Chu stanzas") Luan-nyao is presented as a messenger directed to the goddess Fu-fei (Lo-shen), who became famous for her beauty.
