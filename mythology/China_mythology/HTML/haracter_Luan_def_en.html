The luan (simplified Chinese: 鸾; traditional Chinese: 鸞; pinyin: luán; Wade–Giles: luan²) is a mythological bird in East Asian mythology. The name is sometimes reserved for males, while female luan are called Jīnjī (金鶏; lit. golden chicken).

Chapters 7 and 16 of the Classic of Mountains and Seas describes the luan as inhabiting paradisaical areas where it sings spontaneously. In Chapter 11, its features are reminiscent of the fenghuang. It is said to trample on snakes while wearing one on its breast. In other sections, it is mentioned as carrying a shield.

The Shuowen Jiezi defines the bird as born from the sperm of Chìdì. It is red in color with five-colored markings. Its body is shaped like that of a chicken it sings in the five standard pitches and appears when hymns of praise are sung to rulers.

The Sancai Tuhui states that the bird is the transformation of a divine spirit.

The Japanese Wakan Sansai Zue of the Edo period further states that due to the viscosity of the luan's blood, it could be used as an adhesive for attaching strings to musical instruments.

By the Six Dynasties period, the luan became associated with the Queen Mother of the West.
