In long-term Chinese feudal history, the emperor's son will always ascend the throne. But in the Chinese myth, between the earliest emperors Yao, Shun, Yu, the concession of the throne is not due to family ties. Those who have virtue and abilities are recommended to ascend the throne.

In Chinese myth, Yao was the first emperor. When he got old, he wanted to look for one heir. Therefore, he gathered tribal leaders to discuss this issue.

Some man Fan-Chi said: "Your son Dan Zhu is enlightened, it is expedient that he will take the throne." Yao said seriously: "No, my son has no good morals, he only likes to quarrel." Another person said, “Gon Gon must take the throne, it is advisable. He manages the hydropower. " Yao shook his head, said, "Gong Gong was eloquent, outwardly respectful, but in his heart he was different." This consultation ended without result. Yao continues to look for an heir.

Some time passed, Yao again gathered the tribal leaders. This time, several leaders recommended one common man - Shun. Yao nodded his head, said: “Oops! I also heard that this person is good. Can you tell me in detail about him. " All the people started to tell Shun's deeds: Shun's father is a stupid person. People call him "Gu Sou", which means "the blind old man." Shun's mother died long ago. The stepmother treated Shun badly. Stepmother's son's name is Xiang, he is very arrogant. But the blind old man adored Xiang very much. Shun lived in such a family, but he treats his father of swords and brother well. Therefore, people consider him a virtuous person.

Yao heard Shun's case, decided to observe Shun. He gave his daughters Ye Huang and Nu Ying to Shun, he also helped Shun build a food warehouse, and gave him many cows and sheep. Shun's stepmother and brother saw these deeds, they were both envious and jealous. Together with the blind old man, they repeatedly planned to harm Shun.

One day, a blind old man told Shun to fix the roof of the warehouse. When Shun lifted the stairs to the roof, the blind old man at the bottom set fire to Shun. Fortunately, Shun took two wicker hats with him, he took the hats and jumped like a flying bird. With the help of his hat, Shun easily fell on the ground without injury.

The blind old man and Xiang did not leave, they ordered Shun to clean the well. When Shun was jumping, Old Blind and Xiang threw stones from above to fill the well. But Shun dug one canal at the bottom of the well, he got out of the well and returned home safely.

Xiang does not know that Shun has already emerged from a dangerous situation, he returned home rather and said to the blind old man: "This time Shun died without fail, now we can divide Shun's property." After that, he went into the room, unexpectedly, when he entered the room, Shun was already sitting on the bed playing the instrument. Xiang was very scared, he said embarrassedly, "Oh, I really miss you!"

And Shun, as nothing passed, after Shun, as before, warmly addressed his parents and brother, the blind old man and Xiang no longer dared to harm Shun.

Then Yao observed Shun many times and considered Shun a virtuous and businesslike person. Deciding that he ceded the throne to Shun. The Chinese historian called this form of concession to the throne "Shan Zhan", that is, "to abdicate the throne."

When Shun was emperor, he was hard-working and modest, he worked like a common people, all people believed in him. When Shun was old, he, too, thus chose the virtuous and intelligent Yu as his heir.

People became convinced that in the age of Yao, Shun, Yu there was no demand for rights and interests, the emperor and ordinary people lived beautifully and modestly.
