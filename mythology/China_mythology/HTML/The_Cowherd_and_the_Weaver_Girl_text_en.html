It is said that the weaver Chzhi-nu was the granddaughter of the heavenly emperor; others claim that she was the granddaughter of mother Wang-mu; in the end itâ€™s not that important. She was a celestial fairy and lived on the eastern bank of the Silver River, the Milky Way, and weaved beautiful layered clouds from amazing magical silk on a loom. The clouds constantly changed their color, and everyone called what she weaved heavenly garments, because they covered the sky. And the sky, like a person, must also dress, although the azure-blue, as if stripped naked, clear sky also has its own charm. In addition to Chzhi-nu, six more young fairies, sisters of weavers, heavenly craftswomen, are working on clothing for the sky. Zhi-nu is the most diligent, the most hardworking of them.

And on the other side of the transparent and shining Silver River is the world of people. And there lived in it a shepherd nicknamed Nu-lan - Bootes. His parents died early, so he had to endure reproaches and beatings from his elder brother's wife. Nu-lan could not resist, separated from his brother. They gave him an old ox, and he healed on his own.

The young man worked with all his might, and the old ox helped him. Nu-lan plowed a piece of wasteland overgrown with thorns and thorns, sowed it, built a house. For a year or two, he adjusted everything, so that it was possible to live, albeit with difficulty. Only after all, except for the old ox, who could not speak, there was no one in the cold house - the young man was bored.

But then one day the old ox suddenly spoke in a human voice and told his master that the Weaver, along with other fairies, would go to the Silver River to bathe, and ordered at that time to sneak up and take away her clothes, saying that then he could make her his wife. The amazed Nu-lan obeyed the old ox, set off at the right time to the bank of the Silver River, hid in the reed thickets and began to wait for the Weaver with her girlfriends to come.

Little time has passed. The weaver and the sky fairies came to bathe at the Silver River. They took off their light clothes, jumped into a clear stream, and at the same moment, white lotuses seemed to bloom on the greenish water. Nu-lang jumped out of the reed and snatched the Weaver's clothes from the heap of dresses folded on the grass by the river. The frightened fairies jumped out of the water, pulled on their clothes in a hurry and, like birds, scattered in all directions. And on the banks of the Silver River, only poor Weaver remained, who could not escape. Nu-lan told her that he would return the dress only if she agreed to become his wife. The weaver covered her breasts with her loose hair, but there was nothing to do, she nodded her head bashfully (in fact, she had long had a love for this brave, albeit a little rude guy). So she became the wife of Bootes.

After the marriage, the husband began to plow, and the wife to weave, the two of them healed happily and beautifully. Soon they had a son and a daughter. The spouses were happy: there will be someone to look after them in old age.

But the heavenly emperor and mother wan-mu, having learned about their marriage, were enraged and sent one of the gods to seize Zhi-nu and bring her to the heavenly palace. Mother Wan-mu was afraid that the messenger would not show due diligence, and she herself went to follow him.

It was sad for the Weaver to part with her husband and children, but she had to go to the palace, accompanied by the messenger of heaven. The saddened Nu-lan put the children in baskets, threw them over his shoulder and went to catch up with his wife at night. He thought to cross the clear Silver River and reach the heavenly palace itself, but only who could know that where the Silver River used to be, there were no traces of it left. Niu-lan raised his head, looked - and mother wan-mu had already transferred the river to the sky. In the blue night sky, the Silver River is visible, transparent, clean, sparkling, but now different roads lead to the world of people and gods, and it is impossible for a mere mortal to approach the Milky Way.

Nu-lang went home with his son and daughter and began to lament mournfully and beat his chest. The father and children gathered in a circle and cried. And then the old ox from the stall spoke for the second time in a human voice:

- Nu-lan, Nu-lan! I will die soon. Rip off my skin then, put it on your shoulders, and you can go up to the heavenly palace.

As soon as the old ox had time to utter these words, he immediately fell and gave up his ghost. And Nu-lan threw his skin over himself, put the children in baskets, like the first time, and rushed to heaven. And so that one basket did not outweigh the other, he took a ladle for manure that came to hand and threw it into one of them.

Nu-lan ascended into the sky, swept like a whirlwind among the shining stars, now the Silver River is already visible in the distance, and as if you can see the weaver Zhi-Nui on the other side. Bootes looked forward happily, and the children waved their hands and shouted in unison:

- Mother Mother!

But as soon as they approached the Silver River and wanted to cross it, a large female hand suddenly stretched out from somewhere from the height of heaven. It was mother wang-mu who pulled the golden hairpin out of her head, ran it along the Silver River, and the transparent surface immediately turned into a seething Heavenly River ...

Bootes only cried bitterly, looking at the Heavenly River, and his tears streamed like water this river. What could he think of?

- Father, let's scoop out the Heavenly River with a ladle for manure, - insistently repeated the naive little daughter, wiping away her tears and staring at her father with a couple of small eyes.

- Yes, we will bail it out, - agreed, without hesitation, the sad Bootes.

He did indeed take the ladle, and over and over again began to courageously pour water from the Heavenly River until he was exhausted. The boy and the girl helped their father. Their determination and steadfastness in love for their parents touched in the end the cold hearts of the harsh heavenly emperor and mother Wang-mu. And they allowed the spouses to meet once a year on the evening of the seventh of the seventh moon on the bridge, which the magpies built from their tails. They will meet on the magpie's bridge and complain of their sadness. Chzhi-nu, seeing Bootes, cannot hold back tears of sadness, and at this time a fine rain often drifts on the ground. Women cannot help but pity her and say with a sigh:

- The sister is crying again!

And Nu-lan with children has been living in heaven ever since, and husband and wife look at each other from afar across the Heavenly River. If they really become sad, then they also have a way out - to write letters and pass them on to each other, exchanging news.

On both sides of the Heavenly River, resembling white silk, in the night autumn sky among the many stars, we can still see two rather large sparkling stars - Bootes and Weavers. Right behind Bootes, two little stars are his children: a son and a daughter. Still further - four, forming a parallelogram; it is said to be the weaver's shuttle that the Weaver threw to her husband. And not far from the Weaver, three small stars making up an isosceles triangle are the ox whip that Nu-lan threw to his wife. They tied letters to a canoe and a whip, and so passed on messages to each other. Rather, the sea could dry up or the stone decay, than their love weakened.
