He came into the world many millions of years ago, when there was still no heaven or earth, and everything was in primordial chaos.

The ancestor of humanity Pangu himself was born in a huge egg. And he slept there for eighteen thousand years. And when he woke up, he saw nothing around him but black and sticky gloom. He struck Pangu at random into this darkness, and the egg shattered with a terrible crash. Everything light and pure that was in him immediately rose up and formed the sky. Fearing that heaven and earth might rejoin, Pangu stood with his feet on the ground and propped the sky with his head.

Eighteen thousand more years passed in this way. Pangu will all stand between heaven and earth, preventing them from reuniting and becoming chaos again. His head became the deity of the sky, and his legs became the spirit of the earth. Every day it got higher and higher and the ground got thicker, and with them Pangu grew.

Finally, heaven and earth became solid, and then Pangu decided to rest after hard work. All living things emerged from his body. The sigh that escaped from his chest became wind and clouds, soil came out of his flesh; from bones - stones; from body hair - plants; from the hair on the head - stars; from sweat - rain; from the eyes - the sun and the moon, from the voice - thunder. His bones, marrow and teeth were transformed into shiny metal, sturdy stone and sparkling pearls.

Pangu's tears became the waters of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Pangu's good-natured mood brought about fine weather, and sadness overcast. After his death, his body turned into the five sacred peaks of China. His head became the Taishan mountains in eastern China (Shandong province), his legs became Huashan mountains in the west (Shaanxi province), his left hand became the Hengshan mountain range in the south (Hunan province), and his right hand became Hengshan mountains in the north (prov. Shanxi), the body - by the Songshan mountains in central China (Henan province).

On the island of Hainan there is a place of remembrance for Pangu, where, according to legend, his incorruptible spirit dwells. There is also a Pangu temple in the city of Guilin, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, where pious people make sacrifices to his spirit.
