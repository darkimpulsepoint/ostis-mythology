Isis built herself a secret dwelling - a hut, which could be reached through secret channels in a papyrus boat. After all, toothy crocodiles did not touch the boats woven from papyrus. In her secret refuge, the goddess, shaken by grief, gave birth to a son ahead of time and named him Horus.
In Egyptian myths, the gods appear to be great and powerful, as if, as soon as they were born, they immediately became adults. And only about Gore is known what happened to him when he was a child. The island where Isis hid him was so small that he had nowhere to run. Therefore, Horus had weak legs in childhood. And even as an adult, he did not like to walk for a long time, but preferred to ride on horseback.
Isis, busy with the search for the body of her beloved husband, had to leave the reed dwelling for a long time. In her absence, the goddess of the North looked after the boy. But she had a lot of things to do. The boy was often hungry. And instead of his mother's breast, he had to suck his thumb. And even the adult Horus was portrayed by the artists with a finger to his mouth. This is his habit.

Once, returning to hiding, Isis found her young son sprawled on the ground, lifeless and motionless. He was stung by a scorpion! Isis threw herself on her knees and turned with a prayer for help to the sun god Ra. God heeded her prayers, stopped his heavenly ship and sent the wise Thoth to earth to teach Isis a spell with which to bring his son back to life. Isis repeated the powerful spell. The poison immediately left the body of Horus, air entered the nostrils, and he came to life.
After this good deed, Thoth ascended to heaven, took his place on the barge of the sun, and the brilliant cortege of the gods again rushed with shouts of exultation along the heavenly Nile.
And Horus learned to throw a harpoon accurately, striking the river monsters. Strength filled his muscles. The head was filled with wisdom. He was preparing to avenge his father and, by right of the direct heir, to regain royal power over Egypt.
The evil Set was never able to find the secret hideout of Isis.
