By right of the mighty, Seth reigned in Egypt. But Horus grew up and matured - the legitimate heir of Osiris. He turned to the court of the gods in search of justice: the dignity of the king should belong to him, Horus.
- Horus is right a million times, let us give the crown to Horus, - said the wise Thoth.
“Let Thoth put the crown on his head,” suggested the air god Shu.
A cry of joy escaped Isis' chest.
But the chief judge Ra was terribly angry, because his desire was to leave the crown with Set, although this was unfair. And Set, feeling the support of Ra, shouted:
- I am ready to fight Horus. Whoever wins is the king!
- So we do not recognize the wrong. It's clear to me: the right is on the side of Horus, Thoth objected.
“The king's rank is too high for this youth,” said Ra.
- You do not decide in a divine way! - the gods shouted in unison.
Ra offended, went to his gazebo and lay on his back. And the gods had to go to their homes. So the meeting of the court broke down. And the gods, as well as the people who took their example from them, the judgment was not always quick and right.
The suit between Seth and Horus lasted for ... eighty years. That is how long justice could not defeat force. The evil and cunning Seth constantly used his strength and support Ra. Displeased with the obstinate gods, he cried out one day:
- How will I grab my heavy scepter and begin to kill one of you every day!
Ra did not even bring Seth to restraint. And the gods were frightened. Only Isis unleashed angry reproaches on the unjust Ra and on the fearful gods. Seth was more angry than ever.
“I swear by the lord of the universe,” he shouted, “I will not participate in this judgment while Isis is in it!
And what did Ra decide? No, he did not expel the unbelieving impudent man from the Hall of Justice, but commanded all the gods:
- Cross over to the Middle Island, we will continue the trial there, and tell the carrier Anti: “Do not ferry a single woman like Isis.
This is the unfair decision Ra made. And Isis at first cried with grief: after all, the gods, tired of a long litigation, can agree with an unfair decision when she is not. For the sake of her son, she was ready for anything and decided to trick her into the Middle Island.
