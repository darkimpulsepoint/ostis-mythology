The gods moved to the Middle Island and, before judging and rowing, sat down to eat.
And the beautiful Isis turned into an old hunched over woman. She approached the Anti-Carrier and asked:
- Take me to the island, I carry food in a pot, and in my hands there is bread for my son, who grazes the cattle there.
“I was ordered not to ferry women,” Anti replied.
- But you were told only about Isis ...
- Your truth. What will you give me for the crossing?
- I'll give you bread.
- I will not take risks just for the sake of bread.
“Then take my gold ring in addition.
Anti, by the way, is also a god, coveted for gold and transported Isis to the island. There she resorted to her witchcraft power and turned into a girl who was not more beautiful in the whole country. Seth left the meal and ran up to her, because he passionately fell in love with the beauty:
- I want to be with you, beautiful girl! He exclaimed.

But Isis said:
“Listen to me first. I was the wife of a shepherd and gave birth to a son. My husband died, and my son began to guard his father's cattle. And suddenly a stranger comes and shouts to his son: "I will beat you up, take away the cattle, and I will throw you out." Judge us.
"Is it really necessary to give the cattle to a stranger when the husband's son, the heir, is alive," said Seth. - We must hit the stranger on the head with a club and throw him out, and put your son in the place of his father!
The beautiful girl suddenly turned into a kite. She flew up to the top of the acacia, under which the gods feasted, and shouted so loudly that everyone could hear:
- These are the words of Set, with which he condemned himself!
But Ra also this time listened not to the voice of justice, but to Seth, who was angry more than ever:
- Let Anti be brought and punished for transporting Isis! He demanded.
Poor Anti was brought in, tied up, put on a board and beat off his heels with sticks, so much so that he remained lame for the rest of his life.
And then Horus decided: “So you can spend your whole life in court, grow old and not get justice. You have to fight for justice! "
