 Isis mourned the disfigured remains of Osiris:
- Beautiful youth, return to your home! Return to your sister, to your wife! - the goddess lamented. - I call you and cry so that my cry is heard in heaven, but you do not hear my voice. But I am your sister, whom you loved on earth. After all, you only loved me, my brother, oh my brother! ..
The gods heard Isis cry. The wisest Thoth, becoming an ibis bird, flew in himself. And the sun god Ra sent to her the patron saint of the dead Anubis, who had the head of a black jackal. There was also young Horus, in whose heart the thirst for revenge for his father was growing hotter. With their help, Anubis again folded the body of Osiris, embalmed, swaddled with linen bandages and performed ceremonies over him, which have since been performed over the dead by the Egyptians. And Isis, turning into a bird, flapped her wings, threw up fertile silt, which became dust, and this breathed a second life into Osiris.
But the kindest and most beloved king and God did not want to remain on earth. He began to rule in the kingdom of the dead. From now on, he was called the Lord of the underworld, the Master of eternity and the Lord of the dead, and the black jackal Anubis became his first assistant, who weighs hearts on the scales of justice, after which the dead received eternal life as a reward for virtue or punishment for their sins.

The Egyptians saw in the resurrection of Osiris a guarantee of eternal life. They mummified the deceased, thinking that he, like Osiris, would be reborn in another world. And they even called the deceased "Osiris".
The peasants believed that by sowing grain in the furrow and covering them with earth, they bury Osiris. The greenery of the seedlings turned into ears of wheat, barley filled with the grain of the new harvest - this, they believed, was the second birth of Osiris. The joy of the harvest was overshadowed by the thought that for the sake of it it was necessary to cut the ears with a sickle, and therefore torment the green body of the beloved god. Therefore, the Egyptian priests, following the ancient custom, beat themselves in the chest and loudly wail over the first cut off sheaf, appealing to Isis not to be angry that people are forced to hurt her beloved brother and husband with sickles.
This is how joy and sorrow accompanied the sowing and harvest. This went on for thousands of years, as long as the myth of Osiris was alive.
