Seth was thinking all the time about how to destroy his brother Osiris and take over his kingdom. Meanwhile, the desert was getting deserted. ‚ÄùSprings were drying up in the oases. Nickley palms and bushes. Antelopes, giraffes, and even donkeys and pigs ran closer to the Nile.
... Once Osiris made a trip to Asia. He returned with rich gifts and knowledge about how gods and people live in distant countries. He decided to set a feast for the whole world. He invited Seth to the holiday.
And a cunning plan ripened in the brother's donkey head. Seth sent one of his spirits to Osiris, and he imperceptibly measured the growth of Osiris. And secret work began to boil. The spirits made the chest exactly according to the figure of Osiris. The outside of the box was covered with beautiful designs and jewels. With such a "souvenir" Seth, accompanied by seventy-two accomplices-spirits, came to the feast to his brother. When everyone was amused, Seth suggested to the audience:
- Let's make a game. Let everyone try to lie in this box. Whoever it will fit will receive it as a gift.
For some guests it was too small, for others it was too big. Finally it was Osiris's turn. Unaware of malicious intent, he lay down in this chest-sarcophagus. Seth and his accomplices immediately slammed the lid, tied strong ropes around the sarcophagus and threw it into the river!
And Set immediately sat on the throne of Osiris.
When men begin to violently enmity, women are left with only one thing - to bitterly mourn the dead. Isis, wife and sister of Osiris, a faithful helper in all his good deeds, burst into bitter tears. Nephthys cried with her. She was Seth's wife, but she was afraid of him. And she loved Osiris.
But Isis did not have to cry for long. The evil brother decided to deal with her too. Isis had to flee. She hid in the Nile Delta, among the marshes, in the thick of reeds and papyri. Two desires burned her heart - to find the body of her beloved husband and to avenge Seth for him.
