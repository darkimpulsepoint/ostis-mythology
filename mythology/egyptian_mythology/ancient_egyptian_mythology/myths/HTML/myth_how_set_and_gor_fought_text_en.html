 Seth said to Horus:
- Let's turn into hippos, sink to the bottom of the sea. Whoever survives under water for three months is also a king.
And they sank under the water. Isis decided to help her son. She dropped the harpoon to pin Seth to the bottom forever. But she missed and hit her son!
- Shout to the harpoon to let me go! Horus pleaded.
“Let him go, because this is Horus, my son, my child! - Isis shouted, and the harpoon obeyed. The second time Isis threw a harpoon, and he dug into the body of Set.
- Do not kill me, because I am your half-brother! Seth pleaded. Isis's heart trembled. She pulled the harpoon out of the sea.
Hippopotamuses emerged, turned into gods again. Horus was very angry with his mother that she felt sorry for the murderer of her husband and his father. Not remembering himself from rage, grabbed a knife and cut off his mother's head. True, the head immediately returned to its place, and Isis forgave her son. But he didn't know about it. He fled far, far away from the wrath of the gods, threw himself on the ground by a lonely rock, sobbed bitterly, and then unnoticed for himself fell asleep.
The gods went to all four directions to find Horus and bring him to trial. Seth found Horus sleeping. He grabbed him, pressed him to the rock, pulled out both eyes, and ran away. He returned to Ra and said to him:
- I have not found Horus.
But the goddess Hathor, mistress of the southern lands, did not believe him. She followed in the footsteps of Set and found Horus lying in the middle of the desert. And there were two lotus flowers nearby, into which the eyes turned. Hathor caught the gazelle, milked it. She poured milk into Horus's empty eye sockets, and miraculously revived his eyes. Horus was again ready to fight for power over Egypt.
Seth made his greatest and last vow:
“I will no longer fight and shed blood. We will build ourselves stone boats and race along. Whoever overtakes the rival, let the crown of Egypt be given.
- I agree, - said Horus, - but you all heard - this competition will be the last!
He came up with a great trick. In a secret place he made a boat out of cedar, coated it with plaster and brought it to the pier. Seth believed that Horus's boat was made of stone. He climbed a high mountain, broke off its top, knocked out a boat from it and placed it next to Horus's boat. As soon as the competition began, the stone boat sank. The enraged Seth again turned into a hippopotamus and chased after Horus, who outwitted him, but he accurately wounded him with a harpoon.
Only after this victory obtained by cunning did justice prevail. The defeated Seth said:
- Let Horus be given the rank of his father, Osiris.
A white crown was placed on the son of Isis. Isis, joyful, exclaimed:
- You are a wonderful king! My heart rejoices when you illuminate the earth with your radiance.
Still, Seth Ra did not leave him in trouble. He said:
- Let them give it to me. He will swim with me in a boat along the heavenly Nile, thunder in the sky, and everyone will be afraid of him. And at night he will help me fight the serpent Apop.
And all the gods agreed with this. They crowned their heads with wreaths and began to rejoice in justice, which in the end won.
