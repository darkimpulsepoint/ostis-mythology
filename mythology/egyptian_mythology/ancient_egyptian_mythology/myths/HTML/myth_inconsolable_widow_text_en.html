 A faithful, loving wife, Isis put on mourning clothes, cut off a lock of her hair as a sign of grief and began to wander around Egypt in search of the body of Osiris. On the way she was accompanied by seven scorpions. One evening, a tired goddess approached a house. But the woman who met her, seeing the scorpions, slammed the door in fear. One of the scorpions got angry at the woman's disrespect for the goddess, crawled through the crack, mortally stung her son. But Isis herself had already experienced similar grief. Moved by the lamentations of the woman, she laid her hands on her son, uttered a spell, and the boy came to life. Since then, Isis has become the beloved goddess of all mothers and the patroness of newborns.
And the chest with the body of Osiris was carried out into the sea by the waters of the Nile. He swam for a long time on the waves, until the current washed him ashore far from Egypt, near the city of Byblos. The chest was restrained by a branch of a bush. A tree grew at this place, which hid the chest in its trunk. The local king, amazed by the majesty of the tree, ordered to cut it down and make a support for the palace from the trunk. He did not even suspect that the trunk contained a chest with the body of Osiris.
But the heart of loving Isis guessed this. She went to Byblos in poor clothes, sat down by the well and began to cry bitterly. The queen's maids approached the well. Isis greeted them warmly, combed their hair, permeating them with the wonderful scent of her divine body. Seeing the scythes of the maids that had become so beautiful, the queen ordered to call the stranger. So Isis entered the king's palace.
She opened to the ruler and asked him to give her a wonderful tree. The king did not dare to argue, allowed to remove the chest, helped to transfer it to the boat and even sent his eldest son to sail with it. But this was a fatal decision for the fate of the young man.
As soon as the boat sailed, Isis opened the lid of the chest, fell face to face with her husband, began to kiss him and sob. Unaware of what was hidden in the chest, out of curiosity, the young man approached Isis and looked over her shoulder. The goddess threw such an angry glance at the young man, who intervened in her grief, that he fell into the sea out of fear and drowned ...
Isis herself brought the boat to the Nile delta. She carefully hid the chest in the reeds and hurried to her secret nest to see Horus.
And in these places Set, the killer of Osiris, hunted a boar. He chased the beast right through, through dense thickets and ... came across a chest. Seth recognized him, opened the lid, cut the body of Osiris into 14 pieces and scattered them on all four sides. So the evil god committed another crime, now over the body of a dead brother.
