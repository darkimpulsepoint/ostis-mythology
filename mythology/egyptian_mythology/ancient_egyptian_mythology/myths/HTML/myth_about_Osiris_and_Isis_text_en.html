Osiris is the king of Egypt. It was a very long time ago, after the god Ra left the earth and ascended to heaven. The Egyptians still did not know how to raise livestock, cultivate fields, harvest crops, did not know how to cure the simplest diseases. People were at enmity, between them every now and then there were bloody fights.

But then Osiris became the king of Egypt. He called on the god of wisdom Thoth and with his help taught the Egyptians to sow cereals, grow grapes, bake bread, prepare beer and wine, extract and process copper and gold, heal diseases, build dwellings, palaces, temples, read and write, study astronomy (study stars), mathematics and other sciences. He taught people law and justice. It was a happy time, a "golden" age in the life of Egypt.

Sarcophagus of Set. Osiris was the eldest son of the sky goddess Nut and the earth god Hebe. Then they had a second son - Seth, the evil god of the desert. Osiris, as an elder, became the ruler of Egypt, of which Set was very envious. He himself so badly wanted to rule the country and people that he planned to ruin his older brother by cunning. He conceived a conspiracy against Osiris, and 72 demons helped him in this. Once Osiris returned after a successful military campaign and decided to have a feast in honor of his victory. Seth was able to seize the opportunity. Having secretly measured the body of Osiris, he ordered to make a sarcophagus according to this measure, to decorate it with gold, silver, precious stones. This sarcophagus Set brought to the feast of the gods. Everyone was delighted with such a wonderful thing; everyone wanted to become its owner.

Seth brings the evil plan to fruition.Seth, as if as a joke, suggested that the participants of the feast take turns to lie in the sarcophagus - whoever fits it will get it. Everyone began to try on, but the sarcophagus did not fit anyone. Osiris, unaware of anything, watched what was happening. Wealth did not interest him, and he would hardly go to the sarcophagus just to get it. However, Osiris did not want to offend his brother. He went to the sarcophagus, lay down in it, and Seth and his accomplices quickly slammed the lid, slid the bolt, poured lead and threw the sarcophagus into the waters of the Nile. The sarcophagus was carried away by the current of the Nile into the sea, and there the waves carried it to the city of Byblos and there threw it ashore next to a heather bush. The heather quickly grew and hid the sarcophagus inside its trunk. And then this trunk was cut down by order of King Byblos and made of it a column for the royal palace.

Isis is looking for her husband's body. Isis, the devoted and faithful wife of Osiris, went in search of her husband. She cried and lamented:

	â€œThe sky merges with the earth, the shadow on the earth today,
	My heart burns from a long separation from you.
	O lord, who has departed to the edge of silence,
	Come back to us in your former guise. "


Distraught with grief, she walked and walked, asking everyone she met if they had seen Osiris and finally learned that the sarcophagus with her husband's body washed up on the seashore near the city of Byblos. Isis went there. No one in Byblos knew that she was a goddess and she went to the palace to work as a servant. She served Queen Byblos, nursed her little son. And at night, when everyone was asleep, she put the king's son in the fire and cast spells to make him immortal. But one day Queen Byblos saw this and cried out in fear. This cry broke the spell of Isis, and she could not make the prince immortal. Isis called her real name, cut the column, took out the sarcophagus with the body of Osiris and returned with him to Egypt. There she hid the sarcophagus in the Nile Delta and, covering it with branches so that it would not be visible, went to her sister,together with which she wanted to mourn Osiris and bury him with honors.

Meanwhile Seth went out hunting. He loved to hunt at night under the moon. The villain stumbled upon the sarcophagus, was surprised to see the body of his unfortunate brother, cut it into pieces and scattered them throughout Egypt. Soon the sisters returned, opened the sarcophagus, and it is empty. The grief of Isis knew no bounds, for twelve days she searched for the remains of her husband, until she found them and buried them. And where she found parts of the body of Osiris, she erected a stone stele, and from this came the veneration of Osiris in Egypt.

Isis gives birth to Horus, the future avenger. Then Isis went to the swamps of the delta to hide from the persecution of the insidious Set. There her son Horus was born. She managed to feed and save the baby. Once, when Horus was left alone, he was bitten by a poisonous snake. Returning, Isis saw the lifeless body of her little son. The unhappy mother raised a terrible cry, begging the gods and people to come to her aid. The god of wisdom, Thoth, calmed her and healed the baby with his miraculous spells.

Horus grew up, matured and decided to avenge his father's death.
