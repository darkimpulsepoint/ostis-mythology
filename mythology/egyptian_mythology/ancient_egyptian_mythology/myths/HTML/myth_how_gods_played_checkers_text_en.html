Nut was the goddess of the sky. She often reincarnated, like all gods. Most of all she liked the look of the cow. She rested her feet on the edge of the earth. At night, the stars swarmed under her belly, her children, and between them the silver disk of the moon moved. During the day, the sun god Ra, accompanied by a large retinue, sailed along the heavenly Nile in a boat. Nut's head was adorned with steep horns, which were more beautiful than the most intricate hairstyle. Ra enjoyed getting out of the boat from time to time and resting between her horns. Once, having rested, Ra swam on the way towards evening. And Nut waved her tail disrespectfully. This really hurt the sun god, he was terribly angry and called on the god of wisdom Thoth, who kept track of the days and wrote down the decrees of Ra. - From now on, for all 360 days a year, Nut is deprived of the happiness of motherhood! - exclaimed Ra (and there were just so many days in the year at that time). He wrote down the decree, sealed it in, an envelope, I myself turned into an ibis bird, flew up to Nut's ear and told her this sad news. Tears poured from Nuth's eyes with grief and poured down on the ground. After all, she dreamed of being the mother of not only stars, but also gods. - Do not be sad, Nut, I will help you. Any decree can be circumvented by cunning. He went down to the moon goddess, who was very bored during the day, and invited her to play checkers. The goddess gladly agreed, but ... lost the game. - How will I pay you off? - And you give me just a little of your time, so that Ra would not even notice. The moon paid with twenty minutes of light, hoping to win back the next day. But how can you beat the god of wisdom at checkers! The moon's debt grew. Minutes added up into hours, hours into days. And when they finished the 360th game, Thoth won a full five days! He took his winnings, turned into an ibis and flew up to Nut's ear: - Here's five days for you. Now you can create gods. And Nut created two brothers - Osiris and Set and two sisters - Isis and Nephthys, who of course became gods. Ra had to come to terms. After all, the game was fair, and these days rightfully belonged to the god of wisdom. The sun god forgave Nut and again rested between her horns from time to time. Since then, the lunar year has shortened to 355 days. And five days dedicated to Thoth were added to the solar year.
